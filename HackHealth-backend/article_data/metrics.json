In this presentation, Joshua Klein talks about how building a vending machine for crows has helped to teach people about the empowerment of embracing diversity\u2014particularly biological diversity\u2014as we navigate the ever-changing world together with our animal counterparts.\n\nNotable Excerpt: \u201cIt turns out, we\u2019ve been finding more and more that crows are really intelligent. Their brains are in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are. There\u2019s all kinds of anecdotes for the different kinds of intelligence they have. For example, in Sweden, crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice. And when the fishermen move off, the crows fly down, reel up the lines, and eat the fish or the bait. It\u2019s pretty annoying for the fishermen.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker: Joshua Klein is a fervent hacker of all things\u2014including animals and people and the way they behave. After years of pursuing his fascination for crows, he created a vending machine that mutually benefits him and his feathered friends by training them to collect coins in exchange for peanuts. His CrowBox design has tremendous implications for human-animal relationships in the future\u2014and you can even build your own CrowBox using the free, open source instructions on his website.\n\nPodcast: TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas in the form of short, powerful talks and ideas delivered in 18 minutes or less.

It was great to interact with Ellen K. and the gang, but it was never the podcast I really wanted.\n\nThen, a week ago I woke up with a intuitive itch to do the kind of call-in show I\u2019ve wanted to do for 20 years. And, GNN co-owner Anthony, messaged me that HE had the same idea separately! The coronavirus had hit and, coincidentally, KOST cancelled the show indefinitely because they shut down the studios in LA. The timing was perfect.\n\nSo Anthony and I put on our headphones and recorded the first show on Friday the 13th, talking about how to stay positive in the midst of the virus, how whales are our best allies in the climate fight, how a politician turned things around with compassion after getting racist tweets, and how Congo kicked Ebola to the curb\u2014and other good news. [Note: We\u2019ve already perfected the audio and mic placement in episode 2!]\n\nWe ended the show with a good news \u2018Lightning Round\u2019\u2014and called on fans to chime in on future shows.\n\nWe want to talk to people and have cool software that lets us send a simple link to you so you can call in from anywhere\u2026 Do you wanna be on the show with us?

My company\u2019s revenue more than quadrupled after I got an intuition to answer a routine sales email, which turned everything around. When I adopted my morning practice of focusing on that goal of receiving \u201cthousands more in revenue\u201d, it came to pass effortlessly. Now, I\u2019m encouraging everyone to give it a try.\n\nNotable Excerpt: \u201cSuccess is a system\u2014not a secret\u2026 When people practice the Path to Wealth, they manifest stuff like crazy\u2014I mean, it\u2019s kind of shocking. . . . But sometimes, they really struggle seeing those intuitive leads for the really giant goals that they don\u2019t believe are possible. So, how do we shift beliefs? Using the daily practice on a repetitive basis, and by making what you want seem more familiar and welcome\u2026 (which) will shift your belief into one of possibility.\u201d\n\nThe Guest: Since 1982, May McCarthy has co-founded and grown 7 successful companies in a variety of industries to as large as 250 employees with over $100 million in annual revenues. She believes that her increasing success, fun, and growth are due to her partnership with her own source of intuition. She shares her experience with others as an author, professional speaker, and executive consultant and travels the world with the purpose of elevating prosperity and freedom for all.\n\nThe Book: McCarthy\u2019s first book, The Path to Wealth: Seven Spiritual Steps to Financial Abundance, provides the daily road map to help you achieve your financial and happiness goals. Her second book, The Gratitude Formula: A 7-Step Success System to Create a Life that You Love expounds on her definable, practical system that can help you achieve success in your relationships, career, finances, health, personal pursuits, spiritual growth, and virtually any other aspect of your life.\n\nThe Podcast: The Good News Gurus podcast, produced by Good News Network, is available on iTunes (for Apple devices) and Podbean, for Android devices, as well as on their website\u2019s Good Talks page.\n\n(LISTEN to the inspiring interview below)\n\nSHARE This Podcast With Your Friends Who Need More Prosperity!", "meta_img": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Path-to-Wealth.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9992077946662903}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The Book : McCarthy \u2019s first book , The Path to Wealth : Seven Spiritual Steps to Financial Abundance , provides the daily road map to help you achieve your financial and happiness goals. \n\n The Guest : Since 1982 , May McCarthy has co - founded and grown 7 successful companies in a variety of industries to as large as 250 employees with over $ 100 million in annual revenues."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "8a8db20d-5d5d-4796-b0c6-868954b1c4d0", "source": "default", "data": {"title": "American Brothers Successfully Save Irish Girl Swept Out to Sea in Serendipitous Twist of Fate (GNN Podcast)", "link": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/american-brothers-save-irish-girl-who-was-swept-out-to-sea-gnn-podcast/", "description": "Hear the Good News Guru tell the tale of 4 American brothers in Ireland for a funeral who saved a little girl on a serendipitous day with a magical meaning.", "published": "Sun, 04 Aug 2019 21:42:51 +0000", "body": "\ufeff\n\nFour American brothers who were in Ireland for their grandfather\u2019s funeral ended up saving the life of a little girl on a serendipitous day with a magical meaning.

California, for instance, reported a 20 percent decrease in hospitalizations over three weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stable indicator pointing in the right direction,\u201d as you can see from the chart below from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control).\n\n2) Medical Schools Are Being Inundated With Applications From Those Who Want to Join the Field\n\nThe number of students applying to medical school for the upcoming 2021 academic year is up by 18%.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201chuge spike\u201d compared to the previous year and also a record \u201cconsidering that the Association of American Medical Colleges usually sees an increase about 1 to 3 percent year over year.\u201d\n\nThe surge is being compared to the flood of military enlistments that followed the 9/11 attacks, when Americans became inspired to serve.\n\n3) Drug Companies Say They Don\u2019t Want to Make a Profit On Their Vaccines\n\nBoth Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson have decided that, until the pandemic ends, they\u2019ll sell their COVID-19 vaccines using a not-for-profit model.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, Oxford-AstraZeneca is currently priced at about $3-$4 per dose\u2014which just covers costs.\n\nJohnson and Johnson\u2019s vaccine, which is still to be authorized, will be priced at around $10, but it only needs one dose in order to be effective.\n\n4) India and New Zealand Are Buying Vaccines For Neighboring Countries Who Can\u2019t Afford Them\n\nIt\u2019s inspiring to see countries pledging to deliver vaccines to neighboring nations who might otherwise have trouble getting doses for their populations.\n\nAs part of its \u2018vaccine diplomacy\u2019 campaign, India plans to offer 20 million vaccines to Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, the Maldives, and Mauritius, with many of these aid shipments being completely free.\n\nMeanwhile, the New Zealand government has earmarked $53 Million to make sure its Pacific-Island neighbors have access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, which they might not otherwise be able to afford.\n\n5) Chick-fil-A Manager Fixes Traffic Backup At Drive-Through Vaccination Clinic\n\nAfter the computer system handling registrations went down during a South Carolina drive-thru coronavirus vaccine clinic, the back-up of cars left people waiting for hours.\n\nIn the midst of the chaos, the town mayor decided to contact the local manager of a Chick-fil-A fast-food restaurant, tweeting, \u201cWhen you need help, call the pros.\u201d\n\nAfter he looked over the situation, he knew right away what to do. \u2018There\u2019s your problem right there,\u2019 he told Mount Pleasant Mayor Will Haynie. \u2018It\u2019s backed up because you have one person checking people in.\u2019 Then Chick-fil-A manager Jerry Walkowiak showed them how to do it.\n\nWith the help of a few Rotary club volunteers, they slashed the one-hour wait time to just 15 minutes, transforming the messy traffic jam into a smooth operation that vaccinated 1,000 people that day.\n\n6) The Moderna Vaccine Can Vanquish Viral Variants, Too\n\nThe Massachusetts-based biotech company Moderna has tested their vaccine against two new, rapidly spreading strains of COVID-19.\n\nAccording to Nature, it appears that the vaccine works as effectively against the UK variant as it does against the original form. While the vaccine appears less effective at neutralizing the South African 501Y.V2 variant, it still provides protection.\n\nModerna is now planning to test a booster jab that will enhance immunity against emerging forms of the coronavirus.\n\n7) This All-Female Team Delivers COVID-19 Vaccines by Snowmobile in Harsh Rural Alaska Conditions\n\nPeople living in the remotest parts of Alaska are receiving the COVID-19 vaccine early so they can continue to get visits from family members\u2014all thanks to a determined group of women.\n\nThe team of four is using planes, snowmobiles, and sleds\u2014whatever it takes\u2014to deliver the vaccine across rural northern Alaska. Consisting of a pharmacist, a doctor, and two nurses, the adventurous medical team has delivered 65 vaccinations, so far, traveling hundreds of miles to villages to get the job done.\n\n8) After Recovery From COVID-19, Immune Cells \u2018Remember\u2019 For at Least Half a Year\n\nGood news for those who have already contracted COVID-19: The immune system appears to remember how to make antibodies that can fight off the virus for at least six months following the initial infection\u2014and likely for much longer.\n\nA study led by scientists at Rockefeller University and published in Nature, found that\u2014perhaps due to the \u201cexposure to remnants of the virus hidden in the gut\u201d\u2014participants continued to improve their antibodies months after contracting the coronavirus.\n\n9) Group is Giving Away Free Bags of Marijuana to People Who Get Vaccinated\n\nDubbed \u201cJoints for Jabs,\u201d a community effort has been planned for Washington, D.C. for whenever public vaccination sites open.\n\nDC Marijuana Justice will celebrate the \u201cmomentous occasion\u201d by thanking people for getting vaccinated, with dozens of DC homegrowers lawfully distributing free bags of cannabis outside vaccination centers as soon as the general public is able to get vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for ways to safely celebrate the end of the pandemic and we know nothing brings people together like cannabis,\u201d says DCMJ co-founder Nikolas Schiller.\n\n10) People Are Using Their Free Time to Pick up Books and Read Again\n\nWith more downtime than usual, it seems that many people have turned back to books.\n\nIn the UK last year, for the first time since 2012, more than 200 million books were sold.\n\nBorrowing books also grew exponentially in the US. National Geographic reported that weekly e-book lending increased across the nation by nearly 50% in the months following March 2020.\n\nA survey in Canada showed similarly positive reading trends, with 58% of respondents in a survey from the non-profit BookNet saying they planned on reading more because of lockdowns.\n\nMAKE GOOD Spread Like a Virus\u2014Share With Friends On Social Media\u2026\n\nCheck out: A Pandemic of Good News\u2014The Top 50 Positive News Stories of 2020", "meta_img": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-public-domain-cropped-daniel-schludi.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9984809160232544}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Falling hospitalizations are occurring across 36 states , with numbers holding steady in 12 more states. \n\n Not only hospitalizations , but the 7 - day average of coronavirus cases has dropped significantly , too \u2014 cut by a one - third since its Jan. 12 peak \u2014 according to the COVID Tracking Project maintained by The Atlantic."}, "category": "World"}, {"id": "80e957b4-eef7-4436-a66c-80edc7626d65", "source": "default", "data": {"title": "Most Advanced Artificial Heart Approved For Sale in Europe, Raising Hopes for Those Awaiting Transplants", "link": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/carmats-artificial-heart-to-be-available-for-purchase-in-2021/", "description": "French biotech firm Carmat to make the world's most advanced total artificial heart available for purchase in the second quarter of 2021.", "published": "Wed, 27 Jan 2021 17:27:40 +0000", "body": "A French firm that has long been testing and refining an artificial heart is ready to begin sale of the device in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nCalled the Aeson, the 900-gram device is powered by batteries and relies on sensors and biological materials to detect exactly which function it must perform at any given time.\n\nThe firm Carmat has been working on the Aeson for decades in response to rising rates of heart disease in France and across the world, which it estimates claims 26 million lives every year.\n\nOrgan donor rates in Europe are not enough to meet demand, and so the Aeson will really come into its own as another option for those on waiting lists for new hearts: helping a European demographic of about 2,000 people, estimates Carmat.\n\nMORE: New Harvard Study Says That Men Can Avoid Heart Problems By Doing a Certain Amount of Pushups\n\n\u201cThe idea behind this heart, which was born nearly 30 years ago, was to create a device which would replace heart transplants, a device that works physiologically like a human heart, one that\u2019s pulsating, self-regulated and compatible with blood,\u201d St\u00e9phane Piat, Carmat\u2019s CEO, told Reuters, according to France24.\n\nA second chance\n\nAn Aeson will function for several years in patients.

You can be hands-free, and you\u2019re held up at your center of gravity\u2014a concept in physics that explains how ice skaters and ballet dancers can hoist a person in the air while moving, without falling.\n\nRELATED: Researchers Unveil Ultra-Precise, Mind-Controlled Prosthetic: \u2018It\u2019s like you have a hand again\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s is a major safety issue for people at risk for falling,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Adornato, Adjunct Clinical Professor, Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford School of Medicine. \u201cAnyone using a walker today is a candidate for this device, but you have to have the coordination to put on the belt and tighten it up properly or someone who can help.\u201d\n\nFollowing five years of real-world trials by over 2,000 users, the LifeGlider was officially launched in the fall of 2020.\n\nThough inspired by veterans, the idea of being able to walk safely, upright and hands-free has attracted all kinds of people who have suffered mobility loss.\n\nPersonal stories demonstrate the impact\n\nJosie Ingber, who worked in the high-tech industry in Silicon Valley, was one of the first to try the LifeGlider.\n\nShe had been getting increasingly unstable on her feet due to multiple sclerosis, and her cane wasn\u2019t doing enough for her. She had fallen a couple of times and was starting to think she had no choice but to get a walker or use a wheelchair.\n\n\u201cI chose not to go out or accept social invitations since I always had to depend on someone\u2019s arm to hold on to. I was starting to feel very isolated,\u201d Josie said.\n\nBut LifeGlider was nothing like the walker experience she was dreading. It allowed her to keep working until she was ready to retire.\n\nWATCH: Amazing Video Shows Special Needs Teen Walking For the First Time in 8 Years\n\n\u201cI have been able to do so much more by myself,\u201d Josie said. \u201cThis device has changed my life.\u201d\n\nNancy Troger also had a life-changing experience with the LifeGlider. She broke her back 12 years ago and endured difficult physical therapy to be able to walk with a cane. But Nancy wanted more stability than a cane could offer\u2014and she longed to work in her garden again.\n\nThe LifeGlider, which is FDA approved as a mobility device, not only made gardening possible for Nancy. She was finally able to enjoy a daily walk.\n\nLOOK: Wistful Facebook Comment Leads Dozens of Volunteers to Fulfill Bucket List Wish for Woman With MS\n\nHer neighbor told Nancy that as she watched her walk down to the pier using the LifeGlider, she was able to see the person Nancy must have been before the accident.\n\n\u201cWhen I walk like that, my brain remembers how I used to walk,\u201d Nancy said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain the feeling of that memory, but it\u2019s like putting on your favorite clothing. It just feels right.\u201d\n\nMargaret Fisk didn\u2019t appear to have a disability, but as a sufferer from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the over-flexibility of her joints made walking painful and dangerous.\n\nNot any more. Recounting her first time walking without having to focus on not falling, Margaret said, \u201cI was speaking more coherently, I was engaged with things. I was walking with confidence for the first time in at least two years without every step being ultimate torture.\u201d\n\n\u201cLife-changing is not overstating it,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing locked in my house without nature is a nightmare. The LifeGlider gave that back to me.\u201d\n\nWhether the cause is a neurological disorder, injury, or simply aging, we don\u2019t have to accept mobility limits any more.\n\nA new LifeGlider costs $695, but the company sells refurbished devices for $495, plus shipping, at www.mylifeglider.com.\n\nWATCH a company video to see it in action\u2026\n\nSHARE The Incredible Design Breakthrough With Friends on Social Media\u2026", "meta_img": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/LifeGlider-walker-submitted.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.989201545715332}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Rob Karlovich \u2019s vision for a revolutionary new walking aide was inspired by a news story about disabled veterans returning from Afghanistan. \n\n First , they threw people off their center of gravity by forcing them to lean forward , which made them unstable and more likely to fall."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "db2799df-6fff-4615-a580-8b51646a5c9e", "source": "default", "data": {"title": "6 Different Kinds of Mushrooms And Their Myriad of Massive Health Benefits", "link": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/6-mushrooms-and-their-massive-health-benefits/", "description": "Chaga, cordyceps, agarikon, lion's mane, and more, these mushrooms are becoming more available as health food supplements for good reason.", "published": "Fri, 15 Jan 2021 17:25:24 +0000", "body": "Mushrooms have been used as food and medicine for thousands of years, and it\u2019s becoming more common for researchers to announce new therapeutic interventions based on different species.\n\nEven though it\u2019s common for people to tell you that 80% of mushrooms are poisonous, the ones that aren\u2019t offer nutrients which are often hard to find in more commonly consumed foods.\n\nFor brain health, there are few things better, and many mushrooms are now powdered and sold as \u201cnootropic\u201d supplements, with claims that they enhance memory and mental performance.\n\nOthers have been found to inhibit cancer growth and proliferation, and others are studied for respiratory infections.\n\nPutting aside the traditional use of mushrooms in our society\u2014namely for pizza toppings and hallucinogenic trips, new names for new purposes are finding their way into health food stores and magazines, and here are just a few.\n\n1. For longevity: reishi\n\n\u201cFor over 2000 years reishi mushrooms have been recognized by Chinese medical professionals as a valuable remedy,\u201d reads a study from the American-Eurasian Journal of Botany. Its Chinese name means \u201cspiritual potency,\u201d while it\u2019s also known as the \u201cmushroom of immortality,\u201d and the \u201cmedicine of kings.\u201d\n\nStudies have shown reishi mushrooms strengthen and improve the \u201ccompetence\u201d of the immune system through their content of triterpenes. They can protect the liver, significantly inhibit all four types of allergic reactions, and activate immune cells, particularly ones which kill tumor cells, and invasive bacteria.\n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t demonstrate anti-senescence, lengthen telomeres, or boost NAD+ levels\u2014 hallmarks of the modern understanding of longevity\u2014any one of the things it can ameliorate could just as easily end a life, so in a sense, the \u201cmushroom of immortality\u201d earns its moniker.\n\n2. For respiratory health: agarikon\n\n\u201cThis rare, old-growth mushroom has a multi-thousand-year history of use in Europe,\u201d world-renowned mycologist Paul Stamets told Rochelle Baker at Canada\u2019s National Observer.\n\nStamets is referring to a little-known mushroom called agarikon, which he has worked to protect in North America. He notes that ancient Greek physician Dioscorides actually described agarikon in his works, calling it the elixir of long life\u2014particularly when used to treat tuberculosis.\n\nNow Stamets believes that agarikon and the old-growth forests in which it thrives should be protected and cultivated for use as a public health remedy for coronaviruses, as well as other respiratory illnesses, due to its role as a potent immune system aid.\n\n3. For the liver: chaga\n\nAs fun to say as it is good for you, chaga has actually been extensively studied for use as a therapeutic intervention. Lacking only accreditation as a nootropic, mood regulator, or for other brain-related effects, there is one very important role which chaga can perform\u2014as an inhibitor of DNA damage.\n\nMORE: Slimming and Healthful: Benefits of New \u2018Green\u2019 Mediterranean Diet Revealed in Study\n\nA South Korean study found that 40% less DNA damage was observed in human lymphocytes when treated with compounds brought about by the consumption of chaga. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell, and one of the main immune cells.\n\nAnother study found that chaga inhibited tumor cell growth in human hepatoma cells (liver cancer), among the references for which were other anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, and hepato-protective studies.\n\n4. For\u2026 everything really: lion\u2019s mane\n\nIn a study from the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry that is close to receiving 100 citations, the authors note that they are sequestering a large and scattered body of literature to present the nutritional compounds and effects of the lion\u2019s mane mushroom.\n\nThe reported benefits, according to the researchers, include, \u201cantibiotic, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic, antifatigue, antihypertensive, antihyperlipodemic, antisenescence, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, and neuroprotective properties and improvement of anxiety, cognitive function, and depression.\u201d\n\nFor the authors, they note that it is particularly the anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and immuno-stimulating properties, shown in both human and animal cells, that gives this mushroom such a protective role in our biology.\n\n5. For energy and the brain: shilajit\n\nWhile many people consider this blackish tar-like substance found in the Himalayas to be a fungus, it\u2019s actually a kind of soil called humus. It\u2019s composed significantly of organic compounds, like triterpenes, phenolic lipids, and small tannoids: three things often present in large quantities in mushrooms.\n\nStill, the ancient North Indians and denizens of the mountains there have used it for thousands of years, and its name, Divya Rasayan, means \u201ccelestial super vitalizer.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Dutch Man Invents Coffin That Turns Bodies Into Mushrooms: \u2018We are nutrients, not waste\u2019\n\nStudies have been done on shilajit which concluded nootropic effects, and others which looked at the properties shilajit\u2019s content of fulvic acid, a compound which shuttles nutrients like energy, vitamins, and minerals into the cells in much higher quantities than other carriers like blood cells.\n\n6. For everything else: cordyceps\n\nThere\u2019s little debate about the benefits of cordyceps, which one study noted is used to \u201cmaintain vivacity and for boosting immunity.\u201d That same study noted the only thing misunderstood about cordyceps is whether its nutrients confer protective effects like a nutritional supplement, or whether they\u2019re strong enough to be administered in medicine.\n\nAnother study noted its uses could be described as \u201cadaptogenic, anti-oxidant, anti-aging, neuroprotective, nootropic, immunomodulatory, anti-cancer, hepatoprotective,\u201d and even, the study notes, an aphrodisiac.\n\nYet another study described it as \u201cone of the most valuable medicinal mushrooms and nutraceuticals in China.\u201d The researchers cited other studies that showed both powerful anti-oxidant capabilities, and, perhaps most valuably, a tempering of the release of TNF-alpha and IL-1b-beta.\n\nThese molecules are known as inflammatory cytokines, which, being necessary for wound healing, are one of the major drivers in models of unhealthy aging.\n\nCHECK OUT: Eating Mushrooms a Few Times a Week Could Dramatically Reduce Dementia Risk, Says 6-Year Study\n\nFar from slimy, insect-ridden markers of death and decay, each fungus has huge potential as something bordering between nutritional supplements and outright medicine, and the incorporation of them in your diet can be a great idea.\n\nSHARE the Fascinating News From the Fungi Kingdom With the Mushroom Fans in Your Life\u2026", "meta_img": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Porcini-mushroom-hunter-copyright-Andy-Corbley.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9961667060852051}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Others have been found to inhibit cancer growth and proliferation , and others are studied for respiratory infections.

Before the brain can react appropriately to pain, it must evaluate and integrate sensory, cognitive, and emotional factors that modulate the perception and processing of the sensation itself. This task requires the exchange of information between different regions of the brain.\n\nNew studies have confirmed that there is a link between the subjective experience of pain and the relative levels of neural activity in various sectors of the brain.\n\nHowever, these investigations have been carried out primarily in contexts in which the perception of pain was intensified either by emotional factors or by consciously focusing attention on the painful stimulus.\n\nNow, LMU neuroscientist Enrico Schulz, in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Oxford, has asked how cognitive strategies that affect one\u2019s subjective perception of pain influence the patterns of neural activity in the brain.\n\nIn the study, 20 experimental subjects were exposed to a painful cold stimulus. They were asked to adopt one of three approaches to reducing the pain: (a) counting down from 1000 in steps of 7, (b) thinking of something pleasant or beautiful, and (c) persuading themselves, by means of autosuggestion, that the stimulus was not really that bad.\n\nDuring the experimental sessions, the subjects were hooked up to a 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner to visualize the patterns of neural activity in the brain, which were later analyzed in detail.\n\nCHECK OUT: First-of-its-Kind Clinical Study Finds That Microdosing THC Can Reduce Chronic Pain\n\nIn order to assess the efficacy of the different coping strategies, participants were also asked to evaluate the subjective intensity of the pain on a scale of 0 to 100. The results revealed that the countdown strategy was the most effective of the three methods.\n\n\u201cThis task obviously requires such a high level of concentration that it distracts the subject\u2019s attention significantly from the sensation of pain. In fact, some of our subjects managed to reduce the perceived intensity of pain by 50%,\u201d says Schulz. \u201cOne participant later reported that she had successfully adopted the strategy during the most painful phase of childbirth.\u201d\n\nMORE: Doing Something Nice For Others Can Immediately Relieve Sensations of Physical and Mental Pain, Says New Study\n\nIn a previous paper published in the journal Cortex in 2019, the same team had already shown that all three strategies help to reduce the perception of pain, and that each strategy evoked a different pattern of neural activity.\n\nIn the new study, published in eLife, Schulz and his collaborators carried out a more detailed analysis of the MRI scans, for which they divided the brain into 360 regions.\n\nRELATED: Learn What 370 Schools Are Now Teaching in a Massive New Mental Health Research Trial\n\n\u201cOur aim was to determine which areas in the brain must work together in order to successfully reduce the perceived intensity of the pain,\u201d Schulz explains. \u201cInterestingly, no single region or network that is activated by all three strategies could be identified. Instead, under each experimental condition, neural circuits in different brain regions act in concert to varying extents.\u201d\n\nREAD: First Treatment for Pain Using Human Stem Cells is a Success; Now Moving Towards Human Trials\n\nThe reduction of pain is clearly a highly complex process, which requires a cooperative response that involves many regions distributed throughout the brain.

Resveratrol was examined as it has been found to inhibit one of COVID\u2019s corona-cousins: MERS.\n\nResveratrol was also found to ameliorate other virus like pseudorabies and HIV-1.\n\nThe study found resveratrol to have moderate success, but with luteolin, kaempferol, and quercetin having the largest success. These are all polyphenols or flavonoids that are found in fruits but mostly vegetables, with quercetin being one of the most commonly-consumed polyphenols in society.\n\nFoods and supplements that provide COVID-fighting flavonoids\n\nUnfortunately, resveratrol is difficult to consume with only foods. It has poor oral-bioavailability and despite what your bartender tells you about its presence in red wine, you\u2019d die of alcohol poisoning before getting any beneficial amount of resveratrol from drinking.\n\nIn reality, a supplement is what\u2019s needed, stored in a cold dark environment, and taken with a meal with a moderate amount of fat. Many studies on the beneficial effects of resveratrol have used resveratrol taken from Japanese knotweed, and those looking to follow the science to the letter would seek a knotweed supplement.\n\nQuercetin, which was shown to disrupt the docking systems of SARS-CoV-1 and 2, is found most richly in capers, but also in a variety of vegetables like the leaves of cilantro, radish, and fennel, and red onions and watercress. Kaempferol, found in arugula and kale, is also available in significant amounts in raw or canned capers. Luteolin, with proven antiviral effects on SARS CoV-1, a pandemic in China back in 2003, and can be found according to one literature review in carrots, peppers, celery, olive oil, peppermint, thyme, rosemary and oregano.\n\nRELATED: FDA Approves America\u2019s First Prescription COVID-19 Home Testing Kit\n\nEdited from an article published on World At Large, a news website of nature, science, health, politics, and travel.\n\nSHARE The Health Critical News on Social Media\u2026", "meta_img": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/coffee-sick-in-bed-pubdomain-David-Mao.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9966452121734619}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Gaining a lot of popularity as an anti - aging supplement , resveratrol is a powerful antioxidant that also helps suppress pro - inflammatory compounds like IL-6 and TNF - alpha that are associated with disease , the latter of which involved in every disease known to man. \n\n RELATED : New Study Suggests Mouthwash Can Kill Coronavirus in Saliva in 30 Seconds \n\n Anti - aging and antiviral \n\n One of the principle ways resveratrol influences longevity is by acting as a mimic for the effects of calorie restriction on sirtuin activation."}, "category": "Business"}, {"id": "6f999592-dfe4-4a98-802c-b3c088dd64b2", "source": "default", "data": {"title": "Every Patient Treated With CRISPR Gene Therapy for Blood Diseases Continues to Thrive, More Than a Year On", "link": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/crispr-gene-therapy-shows-promise-blood-diseases/", "description": "CRISPR gene therapy shows promise against blood diseases\u2013in particular, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease.", "published": "Fri, 18 Dec 2020 18:52:30 +0000", "body": "18 months into the first serious clinical trials of CRISPR gene therapy for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia\u2014and all patients are free from symptoms and have not needed blood transfusions.\n\nSickle cell disease (SCD) can cause a variety of health problems including episodes of severe pain, called vaso-occlusive crises, as well as organ damage and strokes.\n\nPatients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) are dependent on blood transfusions from early childhood.\n\nThe only available cure for both diseases is a bone marrow transplant from a closely related donor, an option that is not available for the vast majority of patients because of difficulty locating matched donors, the cost, and the risk of complications.\n\nIn the studies, the researchers\u2019 goal is to functionally cure the blood disorders using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin, which produces normal, healthy red blood cells as opposed to the misshapen cells produced by faulty hemoglobin in the bodies of individuals with the disorders.\n\nThe clinical trials involve collecting stem cells from the patients.

Both were achieved through expressing certain transcription factors\u2014proteins that turn genes on and off.\n\n\u201cThe study sheds light on the mechanisms of ageing, and identifies new potential therapeutic targets for age-related neuronal diseases such as glaucoma,\u201d reads a statement from researchers at Harvard Medical School.\n\nThe new study, published in Nature, was conducted by Dr. David Sinclair, of the world\u2019s foremost experts on ageing-related research in mice.\n\nAlong with genetic research, Sinclair has also looked at how supplement-ready compounds like resveratrol and Metformin affect aging, and his book, Lifespan: Why We Age and Why We Don\u2019t Have To, is a New York Times bestseller.\n\nRepairing a scratched CD\n\nThe science behind Sinclair\u2019s new paper involves the curious process of methylation.

If the scratches could be removed, the record of proper function is still there, and could still be read by the laser in a CD player.\n\nIn his book, Sinclair details the modern theory of aging, which is that changes in epigenetics and damage to cells and tissues prevent the body from properly reading protein-encoding genes, resulting in either faulty, less-functional, i.e. older genes being transcribed, or the proteins not being replaced at all.\n\nHere the authors found that when the mouse neurons were recovering from damage related to glaucoma, the methyl groups which built up over time left, like the scratches being removed from a disk.\n\nThis resulted in a process called demethylation.

One in 6 will have depressive symptoms during some period in their life.\n\nIn this new trial, the researchers looked to see if psilocybin (which has already granted \u2018Breakthrough Status\u2019 as a therapy for untreatable depression) could be effective enough to be utilized as treatment for standard depressive disorders.\n\nRather than targeting \u201creactive\u201d types of anxiety or depression\u2014those resulting from traumatic experiences\u2014his team was urged by public health officials to explore psilocybin\u2019s effects in the broader population for those with long-term, persistent, and less-defined major depressive disorders, because of the greater potential impact on public health.\n\nDepression into Remission\n\n\u201cBecause there are several types of major depressive disorders that may result in variation in how people respond to treatment, I was surprised that most of our study participants found the psilocybin treatment to be effective,\u201d says Roland Griffiths Ph.D., Director of the CPCR, and a pioneer of psychedelic treatment research who published his results this week in JAMA Psychiatry.\n\nIn the clinical trial, of the group of 24 participants, 67% showed a more than 50% reduction in depression symptoms at the one-week follow-up and 71% at the four-week follow-up. Overall, four weeks post-treatment, 54% of participants were considered in remission, meaning they no longer qualified as being depressed.\n\nThe researchers say they will follow the participants for a year after the study to see how long the antidepressant effects of the psilocybin treatment remain, and will report their findings in a later publication.\n\nCHECK Out: Magnetic Brain Treatment Found to Relieve Depression in 90% of Participants With No Negative Side Effects\n\n\u201cBecause most other depression treatments take weeks or months to work and may have undesirable effects, this could be a game changer if these findings hold up in future \u2018gold-standard\u2019 placebo-controlled clinical trials,\u201d says Davis.\n\nBecoming more mainstream\n\nHaving worked at Johns Hopkins since 2003, Roland Griffiths\u2019 psychedelic experiments were first viewed with skepticism, but under his leadership the CPCR has now completed many trials and studies of psychedelic compounds, such as:\n\nMDMA-assisted psychotherapy for war veterans suffering from PTSD\n\nA survey of 2,500 reported DMT users regarding improvement in life satisfaction\n\nUsing psilocybin in place of a common SSRI antidepressant prescription for people experiencing life-threatening cancer diagnoses\n\nHis work has resulted in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration bestowing \u2018Breakthrough Therapy\u2019 designations to other compounds like a chemical variant of ketamine, which was approved in a nasal spray form used to treat depression in veterans in Virginia.\n\nMDMA also won \u2018Breakthrough Therapy\u2019 status from the FDA in 2017, after research proved its \u201castonishing\u201d success in sending PTSD into remission.\n\nMeanwhile, its status as an illegal drug is changing. On Tuesday, voters in the state of Oregon passed a first-of-its-kind measure to formally legalize access to psilocybin mushrooms for therapy, with the state establishing and regulating a program whereby adults can obtain and use them. And, voters in Washington D.C. approved a measure that will effectively decriminalize \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d and other organic psychedelic drugs.\n\nSEND This Research Tripping Over to Friends By Sharing on Social Media\u2026\n\nMORE: Can Mild \u2018Depression\u2019 Be Good For You?

Recently Hill\u2019s farm of 10,000 acres sold its carbon credits for $16.50 per ton, through a Seattle-based startup called Nori, which allows companies and individuals to buy carbon credits to offset their own carbon emissions.\n\nWho paid Hill for putting the carbon back into the soil? The e-Commerce platform Shopify, Arizona State University, and several individuals.\n\nWhile Hill notes that many farmers are still on the sidelines due to the extra cost of special equipment and

enveloping and releasing your feet solely through natural motion\u2014a bit like Tony Stark putting on his Iron Man suit.\n\nThe revolutionary shoe is perfect, says a top Nike designer, for pregnant women in their third trimester, arthritis patients, or those who have lost some or all of the use of their arms\u2014such as stroke victims or injured military veterans.\n\nIn a chipper article on Fast Company, Nike designer Tobie Hatfield recounted the story of how in 2008, the world\u2019s largest athletic shoe and sportswear company received the unfortunate news that their very first employee had suffered a stroke and could no longer use one of his arms.\n\nHatfield was put in charge of designing a special shoe to accommodate one of their most treasured staff members, and came up with one involving a zipper and Velcro.\n\nNow the genesis of that idea has led to the creation of the Flyease Go, an \u201ceveryday performance lifestyle shoe,\u201d that is totally hands-free, and will be released in a slow rollout this year starting at $120.\n\nUniversal design\n\nDivided in two halves restrained by a neoprene tension band, but with a limited, two-stage hinge in the middle of the outsole, the slipper or loafer-like front portion of the shoe arches up to a 30-degree angle as the hinge opens when the shoe is not being worn.\n\nThe heel bends the same, but in the opposite direction, and when the foot is inserted into the loafer-like front, a simple pressing motion closes the hinge, refastening the neoprene band and pulling the two halves together snug around your feet.\n\nIn the past, Nike has drawn inspiration from the titans of human athleticism\u2014Mohammed Salah, LeBron James and the like\u2014but here they\u2019ve taken inspiration from one of the most iconic and universal biomechanic motions of our species.\n\nThe back heel of the shoe has a hard plastic shell, terminating in a small ledge, called \u201cthe kickstand heel,\u201d which is the hands-free mechanism for opening the hinge, and is based on the motion we all do with our sneakers when we don\u2019t feel like untying the laces.\n\nYou know the one we mean, when you press down on

In the Washington, D.C. metro area, this translates to a household of four earning less than $79,600 a year. In the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro area, this translates to a household of four earning less than $95,250 a year.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Housing Equity Fund will provide an additional $125 million in cash grants to businesses, nonprofits, and minority-led organizations.\n\n\u201cIn booming cities across the U.S., many apartment buildings affordable for teachers, healthcare providers, transit workers, and others with modest incomes are increasingly being redeveloped into luxury apartments, causing displacement and reducing housing options for working families,\u201d said Sarah Rosen Wartell, President, Urban Institute.\n\nCHECK OUT: Amazon\u2019s Bezos Makes Amends, Giving $2 Billion to Help Homeless Families\n\n\u201cInvestments like those announced by Amazon that help preserve these existing buildings and maintain moderate rent levels are critical to local efforts that promote economic inclusion and support the stability and economic mobility of moderate- and low-income families.\u201d\n\nThe Housing Equity Fund website details the commitments:\n\nWashington Housing Conservancy\u2019s Crystal House in Arlington, Virginia\n\nAmazon\u2019s first Housing Equity Fund commitment in Virginia includes a $339.9 million below-market loan and grants worth $42 million to the Washington Housing Conservancy (WHC)\u2014a nonprofit organization that preserves homes so they are affordable for moderate- to low-income residents. A typical affordable housing acquisition would be financed with a combination of loans and private investment, with interest rates as high as 15% for certain portions of the financing. Access to Amazon\u2019s lower-cost long-term financing will allow WHC to maintain affordability well into the future in the National Landing neighborhood of Arlington. Amazon\u2019s grants also include $2 million to fund WHC\u2019s social impact work.\n\nWith Amazon\u2019s flexible capital, WHC was able to execute the purchase of Crystal House in under two months, an expedited timeline for commercial real estate transactions. WHC\u2019s finance partner, the Washington Housing Initiative and Impact Pool, created by developer JBG SMITH, provided commercial real estate expertise and an additional loan of $6.7 million. Crystal House will offer a dynamic rental structure. Through natural renter turnover, rents will be significantly lowered to appeal to households earning less than 80% of AMI. The conversion of existing apartments to more affordable apartments began on Jan. 1, 2021 and will continue over the next five years. A 99-year covenant ensures that Crystal House will remain affordable for the long term. JBG SMITH will manage the property on behalf of WHC.\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s investment in affordable housing in Arlington is transformational\u2014and couldn\u2019t come at a better time,\u201d said Matt de Ferranti, Arlington County Board Chair. \u201cWe are delighted to further strengthen our partnership with Amazon and to work together to serve our shared commitment to equity and economic opportunity for all of our residents.\u201d\n\nKing County Housing Authority in Washington State\n\nAs part of Amazon\u2019s ongoing and growing partnership with the King County Housing Authority (KCHA), Amazon\u2019s first Housing Equity Fund commitment in Washington will fund an initial $161.5 million below-market loan and $24 million in grants to preserve affordability for 1,000 apartment homes. The funds, to start, will allow KCHA to complete acquisition financing on 470 recently acquired units across three properties\u2014Pinewood Village (108 units), Hampton Greens (326 units), and the Illahee Apartments (36 units)\u2014preserving these critical resources as affordable housing by maintaining rent affordable to households earning at or below 80% of local median incomes. This commitment includes $4 million of the grant funds to support the preservation of housing for extremely low-income households (less than 30% of AMI) at the Illahee Apartments.\n\nThe Housing Authority\u2019s portfolio currently includes over 7,000 housing units affordable to moderate- and low-income workers. With support from Amazon\u2019s Housing Equity Fund, KCHA will continue to build its portfolio and increase affordability over time by minimizing rent increases. These buildings will remain affordable long term\u2014for at least 99 years.\n\n\u201cAcquiring these properties in Bellevue to ensure that they stay affordable is critical to preserving the economic diversity of this area,\u201d said Stephen Norman, Executive Director, King County Housing Authority. \u201cWe are excited to work with Amazon to preserve affordable housing options close to jobs, transit, and schools. Our whole region thrives when a range of housing options is available to all.\u201d\n\nSince announcing its selection of Arlington as the site of its second headquarters, Amazon has donated more than $19 million to community organizations across the Washington, D.C. metro area. Most recently, Amazon gave $3 million across four legal service agencies to support families and individuals facing eviction issues due to challenges stemming from the ongoing pandemic. In Seattle, Amazon has provided more than $100 million in cash and in-kind donations to Mary\u2019s Place, a nonprofit focused on fighting family homelessness.\n\nSHARE With People in Need of Housing in These Three Regions\u2026", "meta_img": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/amazon-housing-fund.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9871972799301147}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Amazon this month unveiled a new Housing Equity Fund , investing more than $ 2 billion to preserve and create over 20,000 affordable housing units in three communities where the company has thousands of employees \u2014 Washington State \u2019s Puget Sound ; Arlington , Virginia ; and Nashville , Tennessee. \n\n Amazon \u2019s Housing Equity Fund will help preserve existing housing and help create housing developments through below - market loans and grants to housing partners , public agencies , and minority - led organizations."}, "category": "Business"}, {"id": "9cac3f2f-0b8c-4ca1-98bb-9002bece2e99", "source": "default", "data": {"title": "The New Green Building Revolution Uses Timber to Build \u2018Plyscrapers\u2019 That Save Tons of CO2", "link": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wooden-skyscrapers-called-plyscrapers-set-to-transform-the-construction-industry/", "description": "Advances in plywood technology have led to an explosion in the construction of timber skyscrapers, in the US, Austria, Norway, and Japan.", "published": "Mon, 11 Jan 2021 17:02:23 +0000", "body": "Across the world, advancement in plywood technology is giving way to a slew of wooden skyscrapers aptly called \u2018plyscrapers\u2019.\n\nThese innovative towers are beginning to top 200 feet, with one ambitious project in Norway reaching 280 feet, while also creating less carbon emissions, and requiring less time to build.\n\nThe secret to these plyscrapers\u2019 survival and success comes down to a new way to create plywood, and it involves laminating boards of wood together with glue at 90-degree angles before pressing them together under the immense pressure and steam of industrial wood presses.\n\n\u201cThis technology has changed the whole face of timber as a construction material,\u201d said Roma Agrawal, the structural engineer who built The Shard in central London, to The Economic Times. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge leap forward in terms of strength [paired with] massive advances\u201d [in fire safety.]\n\nThe result, known as cross-laminated timber, or CLT, is part of a group of materials called mass timber, and thanks to changes in building regulations and a greater eye towards sustainability, they are now being used in ever-larger construction projects.\n\nBuildings like the Terrace House in Vancouver (19 story), the HoHo in Vienna (24 story), the Ascent in Milwaukee (25 story), and the Mj\u00f8st\u00e5rnet in Norway\u2014the tallest wooden tower in the world, wouldn\u2019t be possible without CLT and mass-timber technology.\n\nHowever, while the thought of cutting down enough trees to replicate a famous skyline seems ridiculously climate-negative, considering the loss of carbon sequestration, the reality is that there are stages in the life of a tree when they become carbon emitters, rather than carbon trappers.\n\nCarbon capturing construction\n\nTrees don\u2019t always store carbon, and they don\u2019t always suck up more carbon than they emit.

By turning that tree into mass timber, the carbon cannot escape through natural processes, effectively making timber towers timber prisons, with carbon dioxide as the inmates.\n\n\u201cTrees store carbon, so if you harvest them at the right age when they can\u2019t absorb much more or grow much further, then it\u2019s a better solution to use them as a building material,\u201d says Voll Architecture\u2019s \u00d8ystein Elgsaas, part of the team that built the Mj\u00f8st\u00e5rnet tower in Norway.\n\nRELATED: Not Only Does New Solar Chimney Design Cut Energy Costs By 50%, It Can Also Save Lives During a Fire\n\nIn a video call with CNN, Elgsaas expands on the idea by adding that: \u201cIt prolongs the trees\u2019 lifespans (by preventing their decomposition) by maybe 100 or 200 years, if done correctly.\u201d\n\nThe International Building Codes, used by many countries as a base for their own local building regulations, have just recently allowed for the creation of wooden buildings to reach 18 stories.\n\nWhile 18-story wooden buildings haven\u2019t existed in modern times, it remains to be seen if planned towers such as Sumitomo Forestry\u2019s W350\u2014a timber tower stretching 1,189 feet in the air, or London\u2019s Oakwood Timber Tower, slightly shorter at just under 1,000 feet, will ever be made based on current building regulations.\n\nCHECK OUT: One of the World\u2019s First Communities of 3D Printed Homes is Set to House Mexico\u2019s Poorest Families\n\nBut new research on fire-resistance, strength, and other aspects that would have politicians and regulators raising eyebrows at CLT and mass-timber construction, as well as a flood of market support and falling prices for mass timber, paints a picture of a culture of timber tower construction that\u2019s preparing to catch fire in architecture firms around the globe.\n\nBuild Your Friends Up With the Good News and Share This Story With Them\u2026", "meta_img": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/norway-wood-skyscraper-released-woodify-as-vjus-as.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9952852725982666}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "These innovative towers are beginning to top 200 feet , with one ambitious project in Norway reaching 280 feet , while also creating less carbon emissions , and requiring less time to build.

Celebrities including John Legend Natalie Portman have all invested in the company.\n\nMORE: Adidas Ensuring That All Their Shoes Can Be 100% Recycled into New Ones Without Any Waste\n\nWhile the new mushroom-based shoes are yet to be released, they\u2019re part of a wider Adidas commitment to the planet that involves an end goal of reaching climate neutrality by 2050.\n\nCHECK OUT: Adidas Makes First Ever Football Jerseys Out of Recycled Materials\n\n\u201cSustainability is an integral part of the adidas business philosophy,\u201d said CEO Kasper Rorsted. \u201cWe have continued to invest in sustainability initiatives during the coronavirus pandemic and we will significantly expand our range of sustainable products in 2021.\u201d\n\nSHARE The Good Green News With Friends This Year\u2026", "meta_img": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/adidas-shos-plant-leather.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9808638691902161}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Adidas has announced it \u2019s launching a line of sneakers made from mushroom - based leather. \n\n As part of a 2021 sustainability initiative from Europe \u2019s largest sportswear manufacturer , the new Stan Smiths will be entirely vegan , and created using mycelium : that is , the vegetative part of fungi that produces mushrooms."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "2dfa3798-45df-470f-b0a4-7c0bcb79de88", "source": "default", "data": {"title": "McDonald\u2019s Gives a New Car\u2014And Golden Arches\u2014to Family Whose Autistic Son Draws Them Continuously", "link": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/mcdonalds-gives-new-car-and-golden-arches-to-autistic-son/", "description": "Tim and Tracy Johnstone have given a new car to a family whose son with autism has been prolifically drawing the golden arches for years.", "published": "Sat, 26 Dec 2020 19:07:25 +0000", "body": "The owners of a Florida McDonald\u2019s restaurant have bestowed some incredible holiday joy on one local family whose 15-year-old son with autism has been prolifically drawing the golden arches since he was a little boy.\n\nTim and Tracy Johnstone met Devon two years ago after Hurricane Michael destroyed their McDonald\u2019s building in Panama City.\n\nDevon\u2019s mom, Tiffany Winters, had posted on social media asking if anyone could recover the famous \u201cgolden arches\u201d from the storm debris to give to her son.\n\n\u201cWhen we heard about Devon\u2019s story and his love for the golden arches, we knew we had to do something special for him and his family,\u201d said McDonald\u2019s Owner/Operators Tim and Tracy Johnstone who own seven restaurants, four in Panama City.\n\nNot only did they deliver the iconic golden arch signage that was saved from the wreckage, they also brought Devon into his local McDonald\u2019s to experience being an employee for the day.\n\nPOPULAR: Watch This Grandmother Working at McDonald\u2019s Get Unforgettable Surprise From a Secret Santa\n\n\u201cOur team felt a lot of emotions after Hurricane Michael two years ago, and to be able to turn around that fear and grief when the golden arches came down and make that into a celebration for such a deserving kid makes this really special to us,\u201d said Tracy.\n\nSo they kept in touch with the teen and wanted to make his holiday super special this year, \u201cjust like that day.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the restaurant owners surprised the family members, who live 40 miles from any town, with a much-needed new car.

The problem is that it\u2019s not always going to where there are hungry people.\n\nThe issues are mostly found in the supply chain: through the interaction of buyers, trying to imagine how many units they need, and sellers who are trying to imagine how many they can sell.\n\nProducers, like sellers, try and make as much as they think they can find buyers for, while the final stage owner of food\u2014supermarkets, restaurants, or hotels, often have too many processes to worry about to consider how best to send food further down the line.\n\nThe efficient distribution of food is an extremely difficult job to take on all the way down the supply chain, and so it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that 30-40% of food in the U.S. is wasted.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no simple way for food suppliers to let food banks know what they have available, or for food banks or pantries to communicate what they need,\u201d writes Adele Peters for Fast Company, covering the Google innovation.\n\nMORE: The 2020 Nobel Peace Prize Goes To The World\u2019s Largest Hunger Program\n\nThe idea is being hammered out at a Google offshoot called X, which styles itself as \u201cThe Moonshot Factory,\u201d and focuses on providing super innovative solutions to make the world a better place.\n\nA better way to bank\n\nEmily Ma, writing for X\u2019s blog on the two years of development and testing for Project Delta, explains they set out \u201cto create a smarter food system \u2014 one that knows where the food is, what state it\u2019s in, and where best to direct it to ensure it doesn\u2019t end up in a landfill and instead goes to the people who need it most.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: First Grader Turns Her Dream of Feeding Homeless People Into Reality \u2013By Launching Her Own Foundation\n\nSome of the problems those working on the problem at Google faced were things like a lack of industry or cross-industry standard for how food suppliers communicate what they have or what they need to move most, or in terms of food banks, what they need and what people aren\u2019t eating.\n\nShe jokes that there isn\u2019t even an industry standard designation for the state of Texas, and that during her and her team\u2019s preliminary research, they found 27 different words in organizational data i.e. TX, Texas, Tx, etc.\n\nWorking with the Southwest Produce Cooperative\u2019s (SWP) food banks in states like Arizona, Ma and her team first built their machine learning prototype, which in place of phone calls, emails, site visits, and paper records\u2014the normal ways the SWP food bankers coordinate shipments\u2014 uploads all records relating to supply and demand into the algorithmic bot which details what should go where, and when.\n\nNext Emily Ma and the Moonshot Factory team went to Kroger to see if they could improve logistics at Feeding America, the country\u2019s largest domestic hunger-relief organization.\n\nRELATED: Company Uses NASA Tech to Make Healthy Food \u2018Out of Thin Air\u2019 Using Only CO2, Water, and Solar Electricity\n\nTheir program insights into the operation of Kroger\u2019s delis, in which meat and other products are typically recycled due to health and safety concerns, allowed them to open up opportunities to give millions of additional meals to communities that need it.\n\nFinally, in a more impressive display of machine learning, cameras installed next to waste bins in Google-facility kitchens were able to collect twice as much information about food waste as the manual by-hand logs made by chefs which took about 30-60 minutes to complete.\n\nThe machine learning can identify trends, such as larger amounts of a particular food being wasted, as well as make recommendations for dishes and ways of recycling that can reduce food waste in commercial kitchens.\n\nSHARE This Fascinating Story With Friends on Social Media\u2026", "meta_img":

Last year Chevron installed EV charging nodes at five of its retail gas stations in California in partnership with EVgo, an EV charging network already spanning 34 U.S. states. As demand for EVs surge, expect Chevron to incorporate EVgo charging systems in many more of its stations in and around major metropolitan areas where people tend to have electric cars.\n\nFor its part, ExxonMobil, America\u2019s largest oil company, doesn\u2019t seem particularly interested in EVs or EV charging. This past Fall its CEO Darren Woods was quoted as saying he \u201cdoesn\u2019t get the point\u201d about EVs when they \u201cend up being charged by power generated from coal.\u201d\n\nMORE: New Lithium Ion Battery Design Allows Electric Vehicles to Be Charged in Just 10 Minutes\n\nThe point is that EV drivers can always look to Shell, which says its EV pumps are powered from 100% renewable energy.\n\nEarthTalk\u00ae is produced by Roddy Scheer & Doug Moss for the 501(c)3 nonprofit EarthTalk.

It\u2019s a tedious, repetitive process with little margin for error and less for change.\n\nSo too, do the lives of countless women who toil at this work follow a pattern. In countries such as Bangladesh, while many daughters dream of pursuing studies that would ultimately lead to alternative careers, without the wages they contribute, their families simply cannot get by.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that 60 to 80% of the garment workers who create goods for such outlets as Walmart, H&M, Next, Gap, Marks & Spencer, and Target are women. While their male counterparts have traditionally been groomed for management positions, the educational divide meant girls were destined to toil at factory jobs for low wages in unsafe conditions because they had no other option.\n\nBut a program launched by the Asian University for Women (AUW), Pathways for Promise, seeks to change that trajectory by identifying women who show academic talent and offering them both an education and a stipend that lessens the burden of financial obligations that leaves them free to study.\n\nWhile the Pathways for Promise met with some initial skepticism, as women who\u2019ve gone through AUW\u2019s earlier initiatives have achieved success, the program is being met with increased acceptance.\n\n\u201cThe impact they can have on being an example in the community and propelling others to follow suit is much more impressive and persuasive,\u201d university founder Kamal Ahmad told NBC News Asian-America. \u201cBeing the first one has a way of altering the pathways of the family.\u201d\n\nSince its inception in 2016, roughly 470 students have enrolled in the program. Of those, 430 matriculated to AUW\u2019s Access Academy pre-college prep program.

Aubert is an expert in figuring out the age of objects, but noted in a media release that cave art is difficult to date correctly.\n\n\u201cRock art is very challenging to date,\u201d Professor Aubert said. \u201cHowever, rock art produced in limestone caves can sometimes be dated using uranium-series analysis of calcium carbonate deposits (\u2018cave popcorn\u2019) that form naturally on the cave wall surface used as a \u2018canvas\u2019 for the art.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026A small cave popcorn had formed on the rear foot of one of the pig figures after it had been painted, so when dated, it provided us with a minimum age for the painting.\u201d\n\nThe subsequent analysis of the popcorn gave the figure of 45,500 ago, suggesting that it could have been painted at an earlier date.\n\nCertainly finding their forte, the same research team of Brumm and Aubert had dated other warty pig paintings nearby, including one last year which was recognized as one of the 10 Most Important Discoveries of 2020 by Science Magazine.\n\nThat discovery dated to at least 44,000 years ago, and contained images of human-beast hybrids, or \u2018therianthropes\u2019 hunting Sulawesi warty pigs together, images which the team believed at the time represented a number of \u2018firsts\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt represents our species first evidence of storytelling,\u201d Professor Brumm said, according to Griffith press. \u201cThe figurative depiction of hunters as therianthropes may also be the oldest evidence for our ability to imagine the existence of supernatural beings, a cornerstone of religious experience.\u201d\n\nMORE: Incredible Cave Paintings 8 Miles-Long Discovered Deep in Amazon Forest: The Sistine Chapel of Ancients\n\n\u201cWe have found and documented many rock art images in Sulawesi that still await scientific dating.

The researchers found that while the agreement prevented millions of acres of deforestation in its first decade, the policy did not appear to hamper agricultural growth or push deforestation to other sectors or regions.\n\n\u201cOver one decade the ASM saved 18,000 square kilometers of forest (almost 7,000 square miles),\u201d said Heilmayr, an environmental economist in the Environmental Studies Program and at the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. \u201cThis is an area bigger than the state of Connecticut.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Canadian Scientists Develop Eco-Friendly Substitute for Palm Oil That\u2019s Good for Human Health\n\nThe authors estimate that between 2006 and 2016, deforestation in soy-suitable portions of the Amazon was 35% lower than what would have occurred without the ASM.\n\n\u201cFirst time, we were able to control for other policies and factors outside the ASM to quantify its unique contribution to forest conservation,\u201d explained coauthor Holly Gibbs, associate professor at UW Madison.\n\nScientists and conservationists were concerned the ASM might prompt soy farmers to begin planting in pastures, thereby pushing ranchers to clear more forest, essentially passing the buck to a different sector. However, the study suggests this did not happen. Gibbs explained it\u2019s likely due, at least in part, to similar campaigns aiming to stem deforestation in the cattle sector. These efforts began in 2008 and resulted in similar zero-deforestation agreements in the cattle industry. The team also saw little evidence that the ASM was pushing deforestation into the nearby Cerrado biome.\n\nPOPULAR: Indigenous Group in Brazil Wins Decades-Long Battle Against Illegal Loggers in the Amazon\n\nAlthough some Brazilian policymakers worry that strict environmental commitments may weaken economic growth, soy production in the Amazon has continued to expand since adoption of the ASM. It increased from 4.9 million tons of production in 2006 to 17.2 million tons in 2019. Ultimately, the moratorium has demonstrated that soy expansion is possible without deforestation, Gibbs explained.\n\nWhat contributed to the moratorium\u2019s effectiveness?\n\n\u201cOne of the strengths of the Amazon Soy Moratorium is that it was a nearly unanimous decision among all the soy buyers in that sector,\u201d said Heilmayr. The signatories account for about 90% of all soy purchases in the region, and this high market share ensured that the agreement would transform agricultural practice.\n\nIf farmers wanted to sell their soy, they\u2019d have to abide by the policies set out by the ASM.\n\nAnother factor that contributed to the ASM\u2019s success was the cooperation of non-profit NGOs and government agencies. The involvement of environmental organizations like Greenpeace, The Nature Conservancy and World Wildlife Fund boosted confidence that the agreement isn\u2019t merely a form of greenwashing. Government investments in satellite monitoring systems and local property registries provided the backbone for monitoring and enforcing the moratorium.\n\nCHECK OUT: Leonardo DiCaprio Launches $5 Million Emergency Fund to Help Combat Amazon Rainforest Fires\n\nTen years on, the parties involved chose in 2016 to renew the ASM indefinitely. While this represents a major victory for sustainable agriculture, the researchers noted that commercial viability is preserved. The Amazon soy sector maintains access to valuable international markets, according to industry trade groups, and at low cost to Amazon soy farmers.\n\nCoauthor Lisa Rausch, a researcher at UW Madison is convinced that the ASM served also to reduce any incentives to clear land on non-soy farms\u2014even in unregistered areas for future soy production.\n\nCurrent deforestation rates are double what they were at their low point in 2012, though they\u2019re still dramatically lower than what they were back in 2003 and 2004, thanks to the benefits of the ASM\u2019s unique mix of public and private policymaking.\n\nHeilmayr believes the consistent global demand for zero-deforestation soy will continue to discourage new deforestation despite any weakening of public policies.\n\n\u201cThe ASM is a nice example of what is possible when companies take aggressive, transparent steps towards supply chain sustainability,\u201d he said. \u201cIt provides hope that private actors can trigger meaningful improvements in the way society interacts with our environment.\u201d\n\nALSO: Farming in the Forest: A Chance to Reverse 1,000 Years of Destructive Land-Use Practices\n\nThe study, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Norwegian International Climate and Forest Initiative, appears in Nature Food.\n\nSource: UC Santa Barbara Current\n\nADD to Fact-Based Reporting By Sharing This on Social Media\u2026", "meta_img": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rhea-birds-and-chicks-in-Amazon-soy-fields-LISA-RAUSCH-study-coauthor-released.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9709965586662292}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "It began in 2006 when Greenpeace launched a campaign exposing the damage of forest clear - cutting for soy the previous year \u2014 more than 1,600 square kilometers ( nearly 4 million acres)\u2014and demanded action to curtail the devastation.

As Jennifer Ackerman brilliantly details in her work The Genius of Birds, new Caledonian crows and a few other birds can not only craft sticks to reach larvae in trees, they can actually fashion sticks with hooks on the end, even going so far as to use composite material to make the grub-grabbing a breeze.\n\nGoffin\u2019s cockatoos live on the Tanimbar Islands, a small archipelago in Indonesia.

Desiring this pebble for his own purposes, he tried to pull it towards him using a shard of bamboo.\n\nImpressed, the researchers replaced the pebble with a cashew, triggering Figaro to stick his beak through the bars of his cage and gnaw off a splinter of wood from the very beam the cashew was resting on, before using the splinter to reel the cashew into his tensile beak.\n\nClass is in session\n\nAt the Goldegg Goffin Lab, part of the Messerli Institute for Research, the avian clubhouse where Figaro and his friends live, lab director Alice M.I.

Demonstrations by Figaro included trimming the branches off a twig, splitting a thin board of larch wood, and even using his beak like a scissor to painstakingly bite cardboard into a long enough tool.\n\nFigaro\u2019s best pupil was Dolittle, who mastered the twig-trimming, cardboard-cutting, and larch-woodworking, while Pipin only managed the twig, having some kind of phobia towards larch wood.\n\nKiwi managed both the larch wood and the twig-trimming, but failed with the cardboard, which researchers predicted would be the hardest task.\n\nIn a moonshot, Auersperg also gave them beeswax, which none of the four birds could manage to work with.\n\nThe \u2018Innovation Arena\u2019\n\nTool-use was just the start of the Silicon Valley careers of Figaro and his friends, as Auersberg has more recently been comparing their intelligence to those of cockatoos that have spent, unlike Figaro, only a short time in captivity.\n\nWith a controlled environment to study both innovation behavior and innovation rate, Auersberg created the \u201cInnovation Arena,\u201d (IA) a semicircle of 20 different challenges all baited with a preferred food reward. Each avian would then have 20 minutes to freely explore, innovate, and get as many treats as they cared to work for.\n\n\u201cIt is, to our knowledge, the first study specifically targeting innovation rate per time unit in animals and the first systematically controlled direct comparison of problem-solving between captive-born and temporarily wild-caught animals,\u201d read the study, published in 2020 in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\nMORE: Snowy Owl Spotted in New York\u2019s Central Park For the First Time in 130 Years\n\n\u201cIt yielded a number of interesting findings, with the most significant one being that long-term captivity does not seem to affect the Goffins\u2019 overall capacity to innovate in the IA but rather their motivation to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cCaptivity bias\u201d is a term used by animal researchers to describe the bump in intelligence, as related to problem-solving, seen in animals subject to long term captivity when compared with their wild peers.\n\nAuersperg\u2019s work presents a new paradigm, at least with birds, that group-identity (captive, wild-caught) could not predict the probability of finding solutions to the 20 problems.\n\nInstead, the unmotivated birds (five wild-caught and one laboratory) consistently couldn\u2019t be bothered to interact with the IA, while the other participants, (three wild-caught and 10 laboratory) \u201cconsistently maintained their interest in the setup and discovered a similar number of solutions at the same rate.\u201d\n\nRELATED: New Research Shows Why Crows Are So Intelligent and Even Self-Aware\u2014Just Like Us\n\nThis research presents a series of fascinating conclusions. First, that cockatoos can use tools, and that they may have evolved this behavior either in the wild, or more astoundingly, without ever having had to use it in the real world. Second, cockatoos don\u2019t need to inherit intelligence through genetic instinct, but can actually learn by watching a peer\u2014characteristics reserved for the smartest of animals.\n\nCHECK OUT: Air Pollution Laws May Have Saved Over 1.5 Billion Birds in American Skies, Finds New Cornell Study\n\nLastly, it demonstrates that cockatoos should maybe be viewed as seriously difficult pets. They can not only live 40 years, but with the intelligence of a 3-year old, require constant mental stimulation if one is to keep them healthy.\n\n(WATCH the video of Figaro making tools below.)\n\nShare This Fascinating Finding With Your Friends on Social Media\u2026", "meta_img": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Figaro-the-cockatoo-University-of-Viennas-Goffin-Lab-ALICE-AUERSPERG.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9998248815536499}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "A Goffin \u2019s cockatoo named Figaro and his friends have long been stunning researchers with their ability to craft and use tools , requiring levels of intelligence thought to be similar to a 3 - year - old human. \n\n Tool - making , either with sticks or hooks , is well - documented in the Aves class."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "80c449b9-3f0f-4221-b357-a9eaabfc3c61", "source": "default", "data": {"title": "30 Years After Big Eruption Put Volcano Mouse on the \u2018Extinct\u2019 List, Research Reveals it\u2019s \u2018Doing Great\u2019", "link": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/small-luzon-pinatubo-volcano-mouse-doing-great-study-finds/", "description": "After the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo on Luzo, the Philippines, scientists thought a tiny mouse that lived there would have gone extinct.", "published": "Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:47:10 +0000", "body": "A small mouse found to live only on and surrounding a volcano in the Philippines has seemingly remained unscathed after the mountain exploded in what was the largest eruption in the 20th century.\n\nDetails on the long-nosed Luzon apomys are scant in good times, but after surveying the damage the eruption caused to the ecosystem, it was presumed they would have mostly vanished.\n\nMuch to Erik Rickart\u2019s surprise, the apomys, sometimes called the Mount Pinatubo volcano mouse, is doing just fine.\n\nRickart works at the splendid Museum of Natural History in Utah, and after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption that caused a typhoon, earthquake, devastating land and mudslides, and ash rain which fell almost an inch thick across 1,500 square kilometers, he was quite content to consign the apomys to history.\n\n\u201cIt was a surprise,\u201d Rickart recounts on CBC\u2019s As it Happens. \u201cBut then when we thought about it\u2014and particularly when we put together the things we knew in general about the kind of environment that has existed during the evolutionary history of all of the animals of the Philippines and the plants as well\u2014it makes sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo was devastating and destroyed most of the forest on the mountain, it was actually very mild, or at least, it was not as intense as previous eruptions that had occurred during the geological history of the mountain.

There are monkeys, snakes, spiders, frogs, plants, and even the longest animal ever recorded.\n\nThey were found all across the continents; from Madagascar to Bolivia, from India to Namibia, from Iran to Australia, and from North Carolina, to Heathrow Airport.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to feel like 2020 deserves to be remembered with a shutter, but the colors and characters of these newcomers to scientific textbooks will give you something nice to remember the year by.\n\nReptiles\n\nA pit viper named after a Harry Potter character, and a girl with kaleidoscope scales.\n\nIn recent years, the Himalayan-lying North Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh has been home to many newly discovered creatures. Most recently is a new pit viper called Trimeresurus salazar, which Harry Potter fans would notice immediately means: Salazar\u2019s pit viper.\n\nThe snake was named after the fictional founder of the Hogwarts House of Slytherin, the crest of which is an emerald green snake. The pit viper certainly looks the part, though the males of this nocturnal species have a unique reddish-orange stripe down the side of their heads.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ha Giang province in Vietnam, an underground specialist was discovered that glows iridescently in the sunlight. Achalinus zugorum is presumed to spend most of its life underground thanks to a lack of bright-light photoreceptors in its eyes, making it incredibly difficult to find.\n\nIts scales glow like the spectrum of Australian opals, and it\u2019s thought to be older than most snakes, exciting herpetologists that it might shed light on earlier stages of snake evolution.\n\nPrimates\n\nA brute of a mouse, and a critically endangered langur\n\nIn Myanmar, four populations of Trachypithecus popa were discovered. The Popa langur species is thought to contain only 260 individuals, qualifying it as critically endangered. Yet as sad as that is, a problem known is a solvable one, and these animals\u2019 long wispy grey fur and charismatic face will have no problem generating conservation interest.\n\nDiscoveries in the primate order are not common, and while habitat loss is concerning, charismatic species like the Popa langur can often be used effectively to protect habitat for other species that are also endangered.\n\nIn Madagascar, the Darwinian playground of evolution produced a species of mouse lemur that had eluded us until 2020. Microcebus jonahi, or Jonah\u2019s mouse lemur, is bigger than others in its family. Averaging the size of a human fist, smaller mouse lemurs can even be as small as the palm of a hand.\n\nSporting reddish-brown fur with a white stripe down its nose, Jonah\u2019s mouse lemur is thought to live only in the dry lowland forests of Northeast Madagascar\u2019s Mananara Nord National Park.\n\nPlants and fungi\n\nHeathrow airport fungus and desert-dwelling African\u2026 broccoli?\n\nIn the southern deserts of Namibia, Tiganophyton karasense, an evergreen shrub in the same order as broccoli, Brussel sprouts, and kale\u2014brassicales, was found to be unique enough to be its own family Tiganophytaceae.\n\nIt thrives where other plants die, in salt pans, under 96\u00b0F heat, and fewer than 1,000 individuals are known to exist.\n\nMeanwhile, in a much colder climate, six new mushrooms were identified, one of which was designated as Cortinarius heatherae, after Heathrow Airport where it was discovered next to a nearby river beyond the confines of the runways.\n\nCHECK OUT: New Species, Devil-eyed Frog, and Satyr Butterfly Not Seen For a Century Found in Forests 30 Miles From the Capital\n\nThree others were found in Scotland, all belonging to the family Cortinarius, which facilitates the growth and health of pines and oaks in the forest.

It\u2019s the first of its species to be found outside of the Mediterranean, and while it seems scary, it only measures eight millimeters long, and displays rather charming behavior such as communal nest building and carrying for other spiders\u2019 young.\n\nThe Ocean\n\nHow could we miss the longest animal on Earth and a species of whale?\n\n100 miles north of Mexico\u2019s San Benito Islands, a research team believes they may have found a new species of beaked whale. Originally thinking it was Perrin\u2019s beaked whale (Mesoplodon perrini), a species that, while never being seen alive, was known and presumed endangered, the researchers changed their tune after closer observations.\n\nIn 2020, what is believed to be the largest, and certainly longest, animal ever recorded was found in the abyssal deep-sea canyons near Ningaloo. 30 new species were also first described by the dive which found a 150 foot-long (47 meter) giant siphonophore of the genus apolemia.\n\nCoiled up like a rope, the creature is more like a jellyfish than a worm, and is actually a colonial organism made up of smaller, specialized polyps and medusoids, collectively known as zooids, which act like humans inside a submarine, each zooid managing a different physiological function such as propulsion or gastric function.\n\nRELATED: Conservation Success for European Bison is \u2018Living Proof\u2019 That Ambitious Biodiversity Targets Work\n\nThe world is a strange place, filled with strange animals, and for children who think there isn\u2019t anything left to discover, a new monkey and the longest animal on Earth were discovered last year.

May, may in fact be the only male reindeer in the bunch.\n\nBefore finding fame in song as well as on film and television, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was the hero of what amounts to an anti-bullying-themed children\u2019s story. In the book\u2019s original cover art, Rudolph\u2019s red nose may be shining beacon-bright\u2014but he\u2019s not sporting antlers, only cute little nubbins.\n\nSo, is Rudolph\u2019s antler deficit due to the fact he\u2019s a juvenile reindeer\u2026 or is it because he\u2019s a boy? We\u2019ll leave that up to you.\n\nLOOK: He Cajoled 17 Dachshunds into Christmas Sweaters For Best Family Photo Ever\n\nBut there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ll say, ere you click off our site, \u201cHappy Christmas to all, and to all, a good night!\u201d\n\nSHARE the Fun Puzzle of This Christmas Mystery Loud and Clear\u2026", "meta_img": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/santa-reindeer-public-domain.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9845173358917236}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "In pretty much every depiction of St. Nick making his iconic Christmas Eve run , the team pulling his sleigh are sporting antlers , ergo , said reindeer are female. \n\n It seems that male reindeer shed theirs in early December , just after the mating season , while female reindeer retain their headgear all winter long."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "4ef44483-b7eb-441c-a530-ac407784aa8d", "source": "default", "data": {"title": "Tiny Pygmy Possums Discovered on Kangaroo Island After Fears Bushfires Had Wiped Them Out", "link": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/pygmy-possums-found-after-kangaroo-island-wildfires/", "description": "On Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia, pygmy possums were found to have survived massive wildfires that torched their habitat.", "published": "Mon, 14 Dec 2020 16:44:39 +0000", "body": "Australian wildlife ecologists were overjoyed to find endemic pygmy possums surviving on Kangaroo Island after it was torched by wildfires.\n\nIn what was the equivalent of finding a very little needle in a haystack hundreds of thousands of acres wide, the survival of the possum on the South Australian island is a sign that wildlife escaped the almost 200,000 hectares burned by this year\u2019s bushfires.\n\nWeighing only seven grams, and having been recorded only 113 times officially by science, it was by no means obvious that ecologists and volunteers working for the Kangaroo Island Land for Wildlife NGO would find the cercartetus lepidus\u2014the pygmy possum\u2014after fire destroyed so much of its habitat.\n\nThe world\u2019s smallest possum, C. lepidus is found only on Kangaroo Island, Tasmania, and in very small numbers on the South Australian coast.\n\nSpeaking with ABC News Australia, ecologist Pat Hodgens, working with the NGO said: \u201c\u2026the summer bushfires burnt through much of [the] habitat that species had, but we were certainly hopeful that we would find them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important now because it is kind of like the last refuge for a lot of these species that really rely on very old long, unburned vegetation,\u201d he said.\n\nIn mid-November about 16 people from the NGO surveyed 20 sites, finding 200 different individual animals of over 20 different species, all of which are endemic and some of which are endangered.\n\nRELATED: Fires Have Helped These Endangered Woodpeckers Make a Comeback, and It\u2019s a Reminder of Nature\u2019s Resiliency\n\nThese included southern brown bandicoots, western and little pygmy possums, brush-tailed possum, and the tammar wallaby, as well as amphibians like the eastern banjo frog, common froglet, painted frog, spotted grass frog, and Bibron\u2019s toadlet.\n\nMORE: After One of the Country\u2019s Worst Wildfires WWF Australia is Preparing for a Year of Renewal\n\nAustralia\u2019s marsupials are found nowhere else in the world, and they suffer from many invasive species through predation and competition for food.

As large grazing herbivores, the constant foraging, digging, scuffing, and breaking they do on the forest floor has been hypothesized as having tremendous revitalizing effects on the ecosystem.\n\nBison kill weak or dead trees by eating their bark or rubbing against them to remove their thick winter fur. This turns the tree into food and habitat for insects, which in turn provide food for birds.

The final blue cone of lightning arced up 31 miles (50 kilometers) from the stratosphere, and upon reaching the ionosphere, triggered \u201cELVES,\u201d an elegant acronym for a rather cumbersome designation: Emission of Light and Very Low Frequency perturbations due to Electromagnetic Pulse Sources.\n\nElves are expanding halos of ionospheric UV emissions and electrons triggered, as their name suggests, when the electromagnetism of the blue jets streak up into the stratopause, the space between the stratosphere and the ionosphere.\n\nUnable to capture the blue jet-elf combo on footage for our eyes, artists at the European Space Agency have used existing footage to render a small video of what it would look like to the naked eye, 273 miles (440 kilometers) above the Earth.\n\nThe data which ASIM managed to capture was used to produce a comprehensive paper of how these lightning flashes occur and how they effect our atmosphere.\n\nMORE: This May Be Earth\u2019s Oldest Rock

Yet Plato seems to have been onto something, researchers have found.\n\nIn a new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team from the University of Pennsylvania, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, and University of Debrecen uses math, geology, and physics to demonstrate that the average shape of rocks on Earth is a cube.\n\n\u201cPlato is widely recognized as the first person to develop the concept of an atom, the idea that matter is composed of some indivisible component at the smallest scale,\u201d says Douglas Jerolmack, a geophysicist in Penn\u2019s School of Arts & Sciences\u2019 Department of Earth and Environmental Science and the School of Engineering and Applied Science\u2019s Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics. \u201cBut that understanding was only conceptual; nothing about our modern understanding of atoms derives from what Plato told us.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing here is that what we find with rock, or earth, is that there is more than a conceptual lineage back to Plato. It turns out that Plato\u2019s conception about the element earth being made up of cubes is, literally, the statistical average model for real earth. And that is just mind-blowing.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s finding began with geometric models developed by mathematician G\u00e1bor Domokos of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, whose work predicted that natural rocks would fragment into cubic shapes.\n\n\u201cThis paper is the result of three years of serious thinking and work, but it comes back to one core idea,\u201d says Domokos. \u201cIf you take a three-dimensional polyhedral shape, slice it randomly into two fragments and then slice these fragments again and again, you get a vast number of different polyhedral shapes. But in an average sense, the resulting shape of the fragments is a cube.\u201d\n\nDomokos pulled two Hungarian theoretical physicists into the loop: Ferenc Kun, an expert on fragmentation, and J\u00e1nos T\u00f6r\u00f6k, an expert on statistical and computational models. After discussing the potential of the discovery, Jerolmack says, the Hungarian researchers took their finding to Jerolmack to work together on the geophysical questions; in other words, \u201cHow does nature let this happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we took this to Doug, he said, \u2018This is either a mistake, or this is big,'\u201d Domokos recalls. \u201cWe worked backward to understand the physics that results in these shapes.\u201d\n\nFundamentally, the question they answered is what shapes are created when rocks break into pieces. Remarkably, they found that the core mathematical conjecture unites geological processes not only on Earth but around the solar system as well.\n\n\u201cFragmentation is this ubiquitous process that is grinding down planetary materials,\u201d Jerolmack says. \u201cThe solar system is littered with ice and rocks that are ceaselessly smashing apart. This work gives us a signature of that process that we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nPart of this understanding is that the components that break out of a formerly solid object must fit together without any gaps, like a dropped dish on the verge of breaking. As it turns out, the only one of the so-called platonic forms\u2014polyhedra with sides of equal length\u2014that fit together without gaps are cubes.\n\n\u201cOne thing we\u2019ve speculated in our group is that, quite possibly Plato looked at a rock outcrop and after processing or analyzing the image subconsciously in his mind, he conjectured that the average shape is something like a cube,\u201d Jerolmack says.\n\n\u201cPlato was very sensitive to geometry,\u201d Domokos adds. According to lore, the phrase \u201cLet no one ignorant of geometry enter\u201d was engraved at the door to Plato\u2019s Academy. \u201cHis intuitions, backed by his broad thinking about science, may have led him to this idea about cubes,\u201d says Domokos.\n\nTo test whether their mathematical models held true in nature, the team measured a wide variety of rocks, hundreds that they collected and thousands more from previously collected datasets. No matter whether the rocks had naturally weathered from a large outcropping or been dynamited out by humans, the team found a good fit to the cubic average.\n\nHowever, special rock formations exist that appear to break the cubic \u201crule.\u201d The Giant\u2019s Causeway in Northern Ireland, with its soaring vertical columns, is one example, formed by the unusual process of cooling basalt. These formations, though rare, are still encompassed by the team\u2019s mathematical conception of fragmentation; they are just explained by out-of-the-ordinary processes at work.\n\nA messy, fascinating world\n\n\u201cThe world is a messy place,\u201d says Jerolmack. \u201cNine times out of 10, if a rock gets pulled apart or squeezed or sheared\u2014and usually these forces are happening together\u2014you end up with fragments which are, on average, cubic shapes. It\u2019s only if you have a very special stress condition that you get something else. The earth just doesn\u2019t do this often.\u201d\n\nMORE: The Quantum Realm\u2019s \u2018Fifth State of Matter\u2019 is Observed in Space For the First Time\n\nThe researchers also explored fragmentation in two dimensions, or on thin surfaces that function as two-dimensional shapes, with a depth that is significantly smaller than the width and length. There, the fracture patterns are different, though the central concept of splitting polygons and arriving at predictable average shapes still holds.\n\n\u201cIt turns out in two dimensions you\u2019re about equally likely to get either a rectangle or a hexagon in nature,\u201d Jerolmack says. \u201cThey\u2019re not true hexagons, but they\u2019re the statistical equivalent in a geometric sense. You can think of it like paint cracking; a force is acting to pull the paint apart equally from different sides, creating a hexagonal shape when it cracks.\u201d\n\nIn nature, examples of these two-dimensional fracture patterns can be found in ice sheets, drying mud, or even the earth\u2019s crust, the depth of which is far outstripped by its lateral extent, allowing it to function as a de facto two-dimensional material. It was previously known that the earth\u2019s crust fractured in this way, but the group\u2019s observations support the idea that the fragmentation pattern results from plate tectonics.\n\nIdentifying these patterns in rock may help in predicting phenomenon such as rock fall hazards or the likelihood and location of fluid flows, such as oil or water, in rocks.\n\nFor the researchers, finding what appears to be a fundamental rule of nature emerging from millennia-old insights has been an intense but satisfying experience.\n\nRELATED: Breakthrough 3D Solar Panel Design Increases Light Absorption By 125% \u2013 A Potential Game-Changer\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of sand grains, pebbles, and asteroids out there, and all of them evolve by chipping in a universal manner,\u201d says Domokos, who is also co-inventor of the G\u00f6mb\u00f6c, the first known convex shape with the minimal number\u2014just two\u2014of static balance points. Chipping by collisions gradually eliminates balance points, but shapes stop short of becoming a G\u00f6mb\u00f6c; the latter appears as an unattainable end point of this natural process.\n\nThe current result shows that the starting point may be a similarly iconic geometric shape: the cube with its 26 balance points. \u201cThe fact that pure geometry provides these brackets for a ubiquitous natural process, gives me happiness,\u201d he says.\n\nCHECK OUT: Hawking\u2019s 50-Year Mystery About Falling into Black Holes Has Finally Been Solved\n\n\u201cWhen you pick up a rock in nature, it\u2019s not a perfect cube, but each one is a kind of statistical shadow of a cube,\u201d adds Jerolmack. \u201cIt calls to mind Plato\u2019s allegory of the cave. He posited an idealized form that was essential for understanding the universe, but all we see are distorted shadows of that perfect form.\u201d\n\nSource: University of Pennsylvania\n\nSHARE This Breakthrough With Pals on Social Media\u2026", "meta_img": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/giants-causeway-ireland-public-domain-joel-nevius.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9941788911819458}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Plato , the Greek philosopher who lived in the 5th century B.C.E. , believed that the universe was made of five types of matter : earth , air , fire , water , and cosmos.

For physicists, a perfect flow is more specific, referring to a fluid that flows with the smallest amount of friction, or viscosity, allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Such perfectly fluid behavior is rare in nature, but it is thought to occur in the cores of neutron stars and in the soupy plasma of the early universe.\n\nNow MIT physicists have created a perfect fluid in the laboratory, and found that it sounds something like this:\n\nThis recording is a product of a glissando of sound waves that the team sent through a carefully controlled gas of elementary particles known as fermions. The pitches that can be heard are the particular frequencies at which the gas resonates like a plucked string.\n\nThe researchers analyzed thousands of sound waves traveling through this gas, to measure its \u201csound diffusion,\u201d or how quickly sound dissipates in the gas, which is related directly to a material\u2019s viscosity, or internal friction.\n\nSurprisingly, they found that the fluid\u2019s sound diffusion was so low as to be described by a \u201cquantum\u201d amount of friction, given by a constant of nature known as Planck\u2019s constant, and the mass of the individual fermions in the fluid.\n\nThis fundamental value confirmed that the strongly interacting fermion gas behaves as a perfect fluid, and is universal in nature. The results, published in the journal Science, demonstrate the first time that scientists have been able to measure sound diffusion in a perfect fluid.\n\nScientists can now use the fluid as a model of other, more complicated perfect flows, to estimate the viscosity of the plasma in the early universe, as well as the quantum friction within neutron stars\u2014properties that would otherwise be impossible to calculate. Scientists might even be able to approximately predict the sounds they make.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite difficult to listen to a neutron star,\u201d says Martin Zwierlein, the Thomas A. Frank Professor of Physics at MIT in a statement. \u201cBut now you could mimic it in a lab using atoms, shake that atomic soup and listen to it, and know how a neutron star would sound.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: His Invention For Renewable Energy Inspired by the Physics of Northern Lights Just Won the 2020 Dyson Prize\n\nWhile a neutron star and the team\u2019s gas differ widely in terms of their size and the speed at which sound travels through, from some rough calculations Zwierlein estimates that the star\u2019s resonant frequencies would be similar to those of the gas, and even audible\u2014\u201cif you could get your ear close without being ripped apart by gravity,\u201d he adds.\n\nZwierlein\u2019s co-authors are lead author Parth Patel, Zhenjie Yan, Biswaroop Mukherjee, Richard Fletcher, and Julian Struck of the MIT-Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms.\n\nTap, listen, learn\n\nTo create a perfect fluid in the lab, Zwierlein\u2019s team generated a gas of strongly interacting fermions\u2014elementary particles, such as electrons, protons, and neutrons, that are considered the building blocks of all matter. A fermion is defined by its half-integer spin, a property that prevents one fermion from assuming the same spin as another nearby fermion. This exclusive nature is what enables the diversity of atomic structures found in the periodic table of elements.\n\n\u201cIf electrons were not fermions, but happy to be in the same state, hydrogen, helium, and all atoms, and we ourselves, would look the same, like some terrible, boring soup,\u201d Zwierlein says.\n\nFermions naturally prefer to keep apart from each other. But when they are made to strongly interact, they can behave as a perfect fluid, with very low viscosity. To create such a perfect fluid, the researchers first used a system of lasers to trap a gas of lithium-6 atoms, which are considered fermions.\n\nThe researchers precisely configured the lasers to form an optical box around the fermion gas. The lasers were tuned such that whenever the fermions hit the edges of the box they bounced back into the gas. Also, the interactions between fermions were controlled to be as strong as allowed by quantum mechanics, so that inside the box, fermions had to collide with each other at every encounter. This made the fermions turn into a perfect fluid.\n\n\u201cWe had to make a fluid with uniform density, and only then could we tap on one side, listen to the other side, and learn from it,\u201d Zwierlein says. \u201cIt was actually quite diffult to get to this place where we could use sound in this seemingly natural way.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlow in a perfect way\u201d\n\nThe team then sent sound waves through one side of the optical box by simply varying the brightness of one of the walls, to generate sound-like vibrations through the fluid at particular frequencies. They recorded thousands of snapshots of the fluid as each sound wave rippled through.\n\n\u201cAll these snapshots together give us a sonogram, and it\u2019s a bit like what\u2019s done when taking an ultrasound at the doctor\u2019s office,\u201d Zwierlein says.\n\nRELATED: We Might Be Able to Stop Tsunamis in Their Tracks by Firing Sound Waves\n\nIn the end, they were able to watch the fluid\u2019s density ripple in response to each type of sound wave. They then looked for the sound frequencies that generated a resonance, or an amplified sound in the fluid, similar to singing at a wine glass and finding the frequency at which it shatters.\n\n\u201cThe quality of the resonances tells me about the fluid\u2019s viscosity, or sound diffusivity,\u201d Zwierlein explains. \u201cIf a fluid has low viscosity, it can build up a very strong sound wave and be very loud, if hit at just the right frequency. If it\u2019s a very viscous fluid, then it doesn\u2019t have any good resonances.\u201d\n\nFrom their data, the researchers observed clear resonances through the fluid, particularly at low frequencies.

Producers began substituting those harmful fats with palm oil for several reasons.\n\nCapable of remaining as a solid in room temperature due to its high saturated fat content, palm oil rapidly became the prime choice for manufacturers, not least because production is nearly 500% more per-acre than the next most-productive vegetable oil crop, sunflower oil.\n\nLooking inward\n\nFor Alejandro Marangoni, a food scientist at the University of Guelph, the challenge was how to create an oil that would stay solid at room temperature, and one that preferably didn\u2019t contain as much saturated fat content as something like coconut oil.\n\nSaturated fat, while necessary in many processes of our biology including the synthesis of testosterone, is capable of exacerbating risks for coronary heart disease when consumed in large portions by individuals with unhealthy lifestyles such as sedentary days or late-night eating habits.\n\nMarangoni is far from the first scientist to have given it a go. Last year two-former baristas attempted to synthesize a substitute from coffee grounds.\n\nMarangoni on the other hand used a process he called enzymatic glycerolysis, inspired by the way the body naturally produces triglycerides. He combined enzymes with glycerin to produce solid vegetable oil without adding any additional saturated fats.\n\nMORE: Bill Gates Has Just Invested in a Company That Grows Palm Oil in a Lab to Save the Rainforests\n\nThe process would allow food manufacturers to avoid the destructive oil palm plantations, while still being able to keep prices low, since Marangoni\u2019s process could utilize most vegetable oils such as cottonseed, or peanut oil, which also happen to contain fewer saturated fats, leading to less of a public health burden.\n\nPlant Some Positivity By Sharing The Good News With Your Friends On Social Media\u2026", "meta_img": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/palm-oil-scientists-released-univeristy-of-guelph.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.7439747452735901}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Their invention replicates how the body creates triglycerides , and can hold liquid vegetable fats in a solid form at room temperature \u2014 the key advantage of palm oil.

To do this, according to National Geographic, the sample needed to undergo a circular heating and cooling process that damaged the DNA-polymerase. It could still work, but it was slow, arduous, and, like continually heating a piece of meat, it caused breakdowns in the proteins that would eventually end the process altogether. RELATED: Scientists Are Creating Waterproof Surfaces Based on Nature That Will Repel Bacteria Too However, Mullis realized that thermus aquaticus\u2014the species of cyanobacteria discovered by Mr. Brock in Mushroom Springs, Yellowstone\u2014spent all its time in water that averaged 191 degrees Fahrenheit, and that the DNA-polymerase from its cells might be resistant to the heat needed to activate the replicating process. Sure enough, his hunch was right, and it\u2019s that process, made from the enzyme found inside thermus aquaticus, that is being used to test individuals positively or negatively for COVID-19. CHECK OUT: Dreading a Dark Winter Lockdown? Think Like a Norwegian After the viral-RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 is converted to DNA, the replicating method of Mullis is applied to areas where the virus is detected, endlessly replicating the cells on a test sample until the presence of the virus is clear or not. If you go to Yellowstone and read some of the placards surrounding the iconic bunches of geothermal features, you\u2019ll notice that one explains the discovery of cyanobacteria and how it changed scientists\u2019 understanding of the fundamental components of life. That discovery has been expanded by further investigations of microbes living on undersea thermal vents, which has put together a picture of what microbial life might need to survive on other planets.

He\u2019s said to have dropped his pistols after firing them in the process of jumping a stream. \u201cPerhaps it wasn\u2019t all he dropped,\u201d de Lisle postulated.\n\nAlthough Duckett\u2019s been hunting buried booty for three decades, it was during his maiden metal-sweeping foray searching a previously undisturbed site that the stunning icon turned up just inches beneath the topsoil.\n\nDuckett knew what he\u2019d found was a Tudor relic, but he had no idea what the 1.4-inch hunk of history really was until he\u2019d immersed himself in research. After three years of sifting through royal inventories dating back centuries, he ironically pinned down its provenance after viewing its doppelganger in a Historic Royal Palaces YouTube video featuring a reproduction of a crown once belonging to Henry VIII.\n\nDuckett made a pilgrimage to Hampton Court Palace to view the duplicate crown in person. What he saw was enough to convince him that the figurine of King Henry VI depicted as a saint he\u2019d unearthed had once been its centerpiece.\n\n\u201cThe very thought that Henry VIII used to wear this figure in his crown on his head over 500 years ago when he was the most powerful man in the land is just mind-blowing,\u201d Duckett told the Harborough Mail. \u201cI can still hardly believe that I have found this magnificent royal piece in a humble farmer\u2019s field near Market Harborough.\u201d\n\nMORE: 4-Year-old Girl Finds Dinosaur Footprint on a Beach From 215 Million Years Ago\n\nBy law, Duckett turned his find over to the authorities who sent it on to the British Museum in London for further study. If it does turn out to be a true piece of the Tudor crown, Duckett and the owner of the site where the royal trinket turned up will receive a handsome bounty from its sale to a museum.\n\nDuckett isn\u2019t alone in his enthusiasm for treasure hunting, and during the pandemic, the number of \u201cdetectorists\u201d as they\u2019re called in the UK, has been steadily on the rise.

While at the moment, the final outcome is still in limbo, Duckett\u2019s not in the least discouraged. \u201cTreasure hunting is in my blood, it\u2019s deep in my DNA,\u201d he said on his Facebook page, \u201cand finding treasure doesn\u2019t come any better than this.\u201d\n\nSHARE This Stunning Find With Your Pals on Social Media\u2026", "meta_img": "https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/prince-henry-viii-wikimedia-commons-public-domain-gold-figurine-social-facebook-figurine-henry-viii-social-media-Kevin-Duckett-.jpg.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9996808171272278}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Some archeological historians speculate that might just be how an enameled gold figurine with an estimated value of $ 2.7 million dollars found its way into the Northhamptonshire field where amateur treasure hunter Kevin \u201c Kev \u201d Duckett found it in 2017.

It is rare that we have the time to really examine what it is that we we want to become, and hope to leave behind as a legacy.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThese are fundamental questions and need good answers.

Unbeknownst to all, the new number wrangled her into a group chat with a bunch of guys who were Buffalo football fans\u2014and she learned why the town in upstate New York is called \u201cthe city of Good Neighbors\u201d.\n\nAmanda Perino told GNN her fantastic story and we wanted to share exactly how things went down after she got the new phone number, and a group of guys just assumed she was a man:\n\n\u201cAlmost immediately I found myself pulled into an ongoing group chat with 10 other numbers. At first I ignored it thinking it would eventually stop, but my phone continued to ping with messages.\n\nIt turns out I had chosen a number that someone had recently given up. This was a group of Buffalo Bills fans, and this was their fantasy football group chat.\n\nEventually I messaged the group: \u201cHey, not sure who you think this number belongs to, but I just signed up to this number myself so I think your friend lost it. \ud83d\ude41 My bad!\u201d\n\nI thought they would remove me from the chat.

Because I rely on my phone for work, I checked every notification coming through, and 9 times out of 10 it was this group chat. I was ready to throw my phone against the wall.\n\nBut eventually I found myself looking forward to reading the texts and laughing at the chat. They were funny dudes. It became my entertainment that week while I was in the States for work.\n\nI started to join in with a smart-ass comment here and there, and in no time I was chatting in the thread as if I knew them.\n\nThey referred to each other by nicknames or initials, so in order to follow the conversation better, I even saved their names in my phone under \u201cBuffalo\u201d so I could figure out who was who: Buffalo Sterner, Buffalo KT, Buffalo Niver, Buffalo BG, Buffalo Horse, Buffalo Sam, Buffalo Rymac. (Yes, I know, too much time on my hands.) My new number had previously belonged to one of the group named \u201cKG\u201d, so they started calling me \u201cNew KG\u201d or \u201cNKG\u201d for short.\n\n\u201cNew KG didn\u2019t chose this thread, this thread chose you\u201d one joked.\n\nBy this time, I didn\u2019t want to let on that I was female, because I didn\u2019t want them to throw me out of the chat. It was like looking into a secret bro window, and I was having fun. \ud83d\ude4a But because I hadn\u2019t blocked the chat, and was taking part in the conversation, they just assumed I was a guy. So I said nothing and never corrected them, and tried not to give them any reason to guess otherwise.\n\nThis was all in the lead up to the Bills home opener, so the chat was around the game and the upcoming tailgate.\n\n\u201cNKG you need to come to a game this year,\u201d said one. \u201cNew KG better come to one tailgate this year or we\u2019ll hunt him down,\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cBuffalo Sterner\u201d wrote: \u201cI have two tickets NKG.

These can be song lyrics, movie dialogue, poems and any inspiring bits you find in your reading and listening. Here\u2019s a guide for making one with modern technology.\n\nGet inspired. The Yale University Library has scanned pages of historical commonplace books in its holdings, and the Harvard Library has a few in its own online collection, as well as images of a version of John Locke\u2019s 17th-century guide to making commonplace books, which was originally published in French.\n\nTake notes. For sheer simplicity, collecting your commonplace entries in a word-processing document stored online is one option. If you find that approach unwieldy, consider the note-taking app that came with your phone \u2014 Apple\u2019s Notes or Google Keep. Just enter quotations and other text snippets whenever you get the urge. If you want to skip the typing or pasting, Google Keep can scan and transcribe text from images of book pages, and Apple\u2019s Siri voice assistant or Google Assistant can create a note and take dictation.\n\nConvert a paper notebook.

Driven away by political instability following the revolution, some of the greatest Russian writers and thinkers of the era \u2014 including Vladimir Nabokov, Marc Chagall, Marina Tsvetayeva and Boris Pasternak \u2014 descended on the German capital, setting up publishing houses, cultural associations and \u00e9migr\u00e9 journals. One of those journals, Beseda (Colloquy), was still trying to get off the ground when a public tantrum by a literary critic named Viktor Shklovsky threatened to derail the entire project. At a lecture sponsored by the journal, Shklovsky had become unhinged and harangued the speaker, a young poet Beseda was excited to have just persuaded to come on board. The editors were, understandably, furious. Shklovsky, tail between his legs, sent a note afterward to beg forgiveness. \u201cI\u2019m certainly in the wrong,\u201d he conceded, but there was an explanation: \u201cIn short, I\u2019m in love and desperately unhappy.\u201d\n\nAlong with his apology, Shklovsky included the manuscript of a new book he was working on, an epistolary novel called \u201cZoo, or Letters Not About Love\u201d that chronicled his unrequited romance with Elsa Triolet, a Russian living in Berlin. \u201cZoo,\u201d which takes its title from the Berlin zoo (near which many Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s lived), was initially meant to be a portrait of Russian writers living in the city. \u201cI needed to write a book about people, something along the lines of \u2018A Hundred Portraits of Russian Writers.\u2019 But I was in love,\u201d Shklovsky wrote years later. \u201cPerhaps I chose love,\u201d he postulated, \u201cthe way a weakened organism chooses diseases.\u201d\n\nHere, Shklovsky refers to his struggles to adjust to life outside of Russia; in fact, the last letter of the original edition of \u201cZoo\u201d is addressed not to Elsa (renamed Alya in the book) but to the Russian government, asking to be allowed back in. He experienced exile as a kind of unrequited love, and thus \u201cZoo\u201d is really a story of mirrored longings \u2014 for a lover, for a country or some combination of the two. \u201cI was bound to be broken while abroad,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand I found myself a love that would do the job.\u201d\n\nIn later decades, Elsa Triolet would move to France, marry the Surrealist Louis Aragon and become the first woman to win the Goncourt Prize (for a book of novellas about the French Resistance, in which she also participated). But in 1922, she just wanted Shklovsky to lay off. She found his letters, which arrived daily, overwhelming, effusive, tediously literal \u2014 in sum, what we expect from love letters. \u201cI love you very much,\u201d he wrote in an early one. \u201cYou are the city I live in; you are the name of the month and the day.\u201d Elsa, flummoxed, told him he could continue to write her only under one condition: that he not write her about love. \u201cMy dear, my own,\u201d she implored him. \u201cDon\u2019t write to me about love.

Musically, she\u2019s found her footing as an outr\u00e9 eccentric with sturdy savvy, an ideal approach for \u2014 and a natural position for \u2014 someone who\u2019s been chewed to pulp by the internet.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Ku Klux Klan. Hoover declared in an internal memo that he sought to prevent the \u201crise of a \u2018messiah\u2019 who could unify and electrify the militant Black nationalist movement.\u201d\n\nUnder Cointelpro, the F.B.I. tried a number of tactics to sow discord within the Black Panther Party at the national and local levels, including sending bogus letters to two of its leaders, Eldridge Cleaver and Huey P. Newton, which claimed that each sought to depose the other. Authorities also arrested Hampton and several other Panthers in an effort to publicly discredit the group. In the months before the raid on Hampton\u2019s apartment, the Panthers and the police also faced off in two gun battles: One in July 1969 at the party\u2019s West Side headquarters in which five police officers and three Panthers were injured, and a South Side fight that November that left two officers and one Panther dead.\n\nWho was William O\u2019Neal?\n\nAt 17, O\u2019Neal (Lakeith Stanfield) already had a criminal record when the F.B.I. agent Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) tracked him down after he stole a car in 1966. But O\u2019Neal soon took on a new role: F.B.I. informant.

Writers and scholars may feel more potential solace in speaking about art that\u2019s clearly invested in racial uplift than they do in unpacking a kind of existential conundrum that demands a great deal more of its viewer and denies the relief of a comforting directive. Now that the spotlight is moving back to nonrepresentational art forms, with it has come a fuller picture not just of Black art but of art itself, and of the artificiality of art-world taxonomies, of oppositional labels and styles that are, in fact, a great deal more porous than they\u2019re made out to be.\n\nTHIS INCREASINGLY REFLECTIVE mood has brought a welcome spotlight to past innovators, bringing the 87-year-old Gilliam, the 77-year-old Pindell, Whitten (who was 78 when he died in 2018) and others of their generation fresh acclaim. Beginning in 2017, museums in Baltimore, New Orleans and Chicago showcased an entire lineage with the Joyner/Giuffrida collection of African-American abstraction, which includes works by Whitten, Gilliam, Edwards and a number of younger artists. Gaines has a new installation opening at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art this spring, inspired by his research into the Dred Scott decision of 1857, in which the Supreme Court ruled that Black people were not U.S. citizens and therefore could not sue in federal court. In October, Pindell showed (in addition to her first video work in 25 years), five new paintings \u2014 some collagelike pieces with text, others expanding on her body of work involving textured abstractions encrusted with paint and paper chads \u2014 at the Shed in New York City. The 74-year-old McArthur Binion signed with his first gallery and had his debut solo museum show only eight years ago, after a nearly half-century career; his hand-drawn grids have become increasingly intimate through the years, more recently appearing layered over personal documents or photographs in a kind of autobiographical abstraction.\n\nGilliam recently showed three different bodies of new work at New York\u2019s Pace Gallery, including an enthralling set of beveled-edge canvases that appear from a distance as largely black or white, but up close contain entire galaxies of colored flecks, their layers of sawdust and paint creating an impression of great depth, as though one could fall into a painting and float away, suspended within its force field. (The paintings pay homage, in their titles, to some of his personal heroes, including Serena Williams and the late civil rights leader Representative John Lewis.) But for anyone who hasn\u2019t been in the same room as a Gilliam painting, perhaps the best place to discover his work is at Dia Beacon in upstate New York, known for its collection of Minimalist and Pop Art, and where, in 2019, the artist installed \u201cDouble Merge,\u201d two grandly scaled canvases he painted in 1968, retwisted and draped from the ceiling to span the entire room, creating a double rainbow, essentially, of melting colors with a double history, a now and then, attached: the tension between the past in which it was made and our own uneasy present. When Gilliam was liberating paintings from the wall, Jimi Hendrix was at his most psychedelic and social revolutions were taking hold around the globe. (Gilliam has spoken of music as a metaphor in his way of approaching \u201cthe acrobatics of art.\u201d) While viewing these works, one might consider what has and hasn\u2019t changed since the two canvases were painted, or the almost unbearably tender display of beauty and mystery in the face of a callously technological age \u2014 or (as I did) one might feel time disappear entirely, such is the exhilarating receptivity of the work in a contained space: a phenomenon that surpasses mere comprehension.", "meta_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/12/t-magazine/12tmag-abstract-slide-WIDD/12tmag-abstract-slide-WIDD-facebookJumbo.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9975568652153015}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Beginning in 2017 , museums in Baltimore , New Orleans and Chicago showcased an entire lineage with the Joyner / Giuffrida collection of African - American abstraction , which includes works by Whitten , Gilliam , Edwards and a number of younger artists.

Smith never excuses what he heard and saw: homophobia, misogyny, racism and not-too-regretful boasting of past crimes. But he doesn\u2019t define the men by that either. He focuses throughout on actions, of his oil-field \u201cbrothers\u201d like Huck, a charismatic giant with a fantastic knack for trouble, and of his real family, marked by bad luck and a bad father. By doing so, he refuses to spoon-feed us judgment; his writing keeps people alive in their histories, talents, humor and mistakes.\n\nThere is a unifying principle in Smith\u2019s depictions: the good hand, from oil-field slang for a worker. \u201cA good hand,\u201d Smith writes, \u201cshows up early.

A good hand makes the hands around him better.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is a good hand all the time,\u201d Smith qualifies. And that is the essence of his book.

Some of his earliest gigs came in the bands of the famed Latin jazz percussionists Mongo Santamar\u00eda and Willie Bobo, as well as with the swing-era vocalist and bandleader Cab Calloway.\n\nIn 1968 he assumed the piano chair in Davis\u2019s influential quintet, replacing Mr. Hancock.

(Riverhead, $28.) Part study of suburbia, part globe-trotting adventure, Lee\u2019s latest novel follows a young man from a transformative trip in Asia to a low-key life in a New Jersey town. Reflective, precise writing and a steady churn of pleasures and perils make for a winning combination. \u201cLee\u2019s real subject here is a global economy made from desires and appetites that don\u2019t transcend race and national borders as much as they exploit them,\u201d Alexander Chee writes in his review, \u201cappetites that can be fulfilled because of, and not in spite of, stunning inequities.\u201d\n\nEXTRATERRESTRIAL: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth, by Avi Loeb. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $27.) You may not buy Loeb\u2019s argument that the cigar-shaped object that streaked through our solar system in 2017 was alien technology. But his search for intelligent life, couched in a moving account of his path to the top of Harvard\u2019s astronomy department, is fascinating and persuasive. \u201cIt is fair to say that Loeb, who was raised with a philosophical bent on a farm in Israel, the son of refugees from the Holocaust and war-torn Europe, is one of the more imaginative and articulate scientists around,\u201d Dennis Overbye writes in his review. \u201cModern academic science, he complains, has overvalued topics such as multiple dimensions and multiple universes, for which there is no evidence, and undervalued the search for life out there.\u201d\n\nTHE RATLINE: The Exalted Life and Mysterious Death of a Nazi Fugitive, by Philippe Sands. (Knopf, $30.) Using a trove of archival and personal documents, Sands tells the gripping story of a Nazi mass murderer responsible for the deaths of thousands who managed to elude his pursuers until his death in Rome in 1949. \u201c\u2018The Ratline\u2019 is a Nazi love story, but a fascinating and important one, told in vivid detail,\u201d Rachel Donadio writes in her review. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that Europe to this day is populated by survivors and perpetrators of World War II \u2014 a place of tangled family histories and selective denial, but also intermittent lucidity.\u201d\n\nLET THE LORD SORT THEM: The Rise and Fall of the Death Penalty, by Maurice Chammah. (Crown. $28.) The number of inmates on death row has been declining for years, and Chammah\u2019s thoroughly reported, essential history, which includes interviews with inmates, wardens, activists, prosecutors and politicians, delivers a surprising account of how and why the death penalty is dying. \u201cAs it tells that focused tale, it becomes \u2014 almost unwittingly \u2014 a case study that speaks more broadly to our current moment, about building monumental change brick by brick,\u201d Anand Giridharadas writes in his review. \u201cIn a season of American life when so many want to get big things done and few seem to get anywhere, this story of the slow slaying of the death penalty \u2014 one that flies against many of my own intuitions \u2014 serves as a vaccine against the virus of fatalism.\u201d\n\nSANCTUARY: A Memoir, by Emily Rapp Black.

At the Parisian Exposition of 1867, the first in which Japan itself participated, roughly nine million visitors saw not merely examples of work by the most acclaimed ukiyo-e masters and a re-enactment of the tea ceremony along with geishas brought over by the wealthy merchant Shimizu Usaburo but also the Service Rousseau, enameled cranes by the silversmith Christofle and Jardin Japonais, a vibrant hand-blocked scenic wallpaper by the Alsace-based Zuber, which produces the pattern to this day. By the third time Paris hosted the fair, in 1878, the crush of spectators and buyers for the Japonist items, from small vases to thimble-size teacups, was so fierce that everything sold out in the early weeks. The influential critic Ernest Chesneau wrote that Japonisme was \u201cno longer a fashion, it\u2019s infatuation, it\u2019s insanity.\u201d\n\nMuch like today\u2019s art fairs, exactly what the public saw was controlled by a powerful network of dealers and influential critics, including Chesneau, Edmond de Goncourt and Louis Gonse, the editor in chief of the Gazette des Beaux-Arts. Japanese antiques entered France by way of shops including Louise Desoye\u2019s Rue de Rivoli store, E. Desoye, which became an informal salon for sharing the aesthetics of Japanese objects populated by the likes of the poet Charles Baudelaire, the Pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rosetti and the society portraitist James Tissot, whose lavish villa on what would later become Avenue Foch was done up in extravagant Japanese silks dyed with techniques including yuzen (an early Edo-era innovation in which starch is applied around the delicate pattern outlines to prevent the colors from blending), as well as vases that he used as props in paintings including 1869-70\u2019s \u201cYoung Women Looking at Japanese Objects.\u201d (Lazily inserting Japanese items into a painting instead of internalizing the ethos was often derided as \u201cJaponaiserie\u201d by critics.) Monet, who once said that Japanese art \u201cevokes presence through shadow, the whole through the fragment,\u201d filled his house in Giverny with woodblock prints and ceramics from E. Desoye; the Japanese-style water garden he created in 1893 that inspired his most well-known series of works \u2014 its bridge covered in wisteria, the pond bristling with bamboo and nymph\u00e9as blooming through the summer \u2014 challenged the stiff formality of French landscapes.\n\nBUT IF THERE WAS a single person who braided together Japanese art, Japonisme and the then-still-nascent Modernism movement, it was the German-born, Paris-based dealer Siegfried Bing. Like his fellow Parisian Paul Durand-Ruel, who brought fame to the Impressionists, and the Italian-American dealer Leo Castelli in New York City some 70 years later, Bing\u2019s taste and ambition created a massive commercial enterprise. His brother, August, lived in Yokohama, where he bought 18th- and 19th-century pieces to sell at Bing\u2019s shops in the Ninth Arrondissement. Marcel Proust marveled over Japanese objects shown to him by his friend Marie Nordlinger, a Bing employee; a young van Gogh acquired hundreds of ukiyo-e, which he used as inspiration for his own work. Convinced that France, even all of humanity, needed to be saved from the decline of quality ushered in by the industrial age, in 1888 Bing debuted Le Japon Artistique, one of the most aesthetically influential magazines ever printed. It ran for 36 monthly issues until 1891, and covered Japanese art and design, as well as poetry, architecture and theater. (The critic Alfred Lequeux wrote that the central runway from the stage into the audience used in Kabuki performances might be the breakthrough that staid French dramatists were looking for.) The publication\u2019s impact was profound: Jewelers, including Louis Cartier, a grandson of the namesake house\u2019s founder, adapted illustrations of wisteria into a series of diamond clusters; in 1906, 15 years after the final issue, Gustav Klimt collected the full run of the magazine.", "meta_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/10/t-magazine/10tmag-japonisme-slide-JI99/10tmag-japonisme-slide-JI99-facebookJumbo.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.999557375907898}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The influential critic Ernest Chesneau wrote that Japonisme was \u201c no longer a fashion , it \u2019s infatuation , it \u2019s insanity \u201d.

So are you more or less optimistic that a longer 162-game season can be completed?\n\nThe thing that I have some optimism about \u2014 but I would have to underscore that it\u2019s cautious optimism \u2014 is that, even though the cases are high relative to this time last year, they are on the down slope. And as every day goes by, it looks like it gets less and less. If you look at a month or so ago, we were having 300,000 to 400,000 cases a day. Now for the last few days in a row, we\u2019ve had less than 100,000 cases, which is remarkably diminished.\n\nSo as the slopes keep going down, we\u2019re going in the right direction. Superpose upon that the fact that we now have highly efficacious vaccines that are being rolled out. We are vaccinating more and more people each day. And we will have more and more vaccines available as the weeks and the months go by. So it looks like we\u2019re heading in the right direction. Whether or not it stays in that direction is going to depend on a bunch of things: Are people going to continue to be careful and to implement public health measures? What is going to happen with the variants? Are they going to make things more difficult by having an additional spike in infections? I don\u2019t know.\n\nThe big wild card in this is really the variants. Because the variant that is in the U.K. that is likely going to become more dominant in the U.S., the models tell us that will happen probably by the end of March. If we don\u2019t adhere to public health measures the way we should, that could take off on us. That\u2019s the reason why I say I\u2019m cautiously optimistic because we could turn around and go the opposite direction pretty quickly.\n\nThe regulations may vary across different communities, but what do you think of the likelihood that there will be fans in the stands during spring training and the regular season?\n\nThe positive aspect of baseball is that most of it is outdoors. And if you space people well enough, you get people to wear masks, you have situations that people don\u2019t crowd at the concessions near each other to get food and things like that, you can pull it off in a pretty safe way, I believe.", "meta_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/14/sports/13mlb-fauci-1/13mlb-fauci-1-facebookJumbo.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.7988619804382324}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Although cases are trending down , they are still higher than when the 2020 season started on July 23.

So are you more or less optimistic that a longer 162-game season can be completed?\n\nThe thing that I have some optimism about \u2014 but I would have to underscore that it\u2019s cautious optimism \u2014 is that, even though the cases are high relative to this time last year, they are on the down slope. And as every day goes by, it looks like it gets less and less. If you look at a month or so ago, we were having 300,000 to 400,000 cases a day. Now for the last few days in a row, we\u2019ve had less than 100,000 cases, which is remarkably diminished.\n\nSo as the slopes keep going down, we\u2019re going in the right direction. Superpose upon that the fact that we now have highly efficacious vaccines that are being rolled out. We are vaccinating more and more people each day. And we will have more and more vaccines available as the weeks and the months go by. So it looks like we\u2019re heading in the right direction. Whether or not it stays in that direction is going to depend on a bunch of things: Are people going to continue to be careful and to implement public health measures? What is going to happen with the variants? Are they going to make things more difficult by having an additional spike in infections? I don\u2019t know.\n\nThe big wild card in this is really the variants. Because the variant that is in the U.K. that is likely going to become more dominant in the U.S., the models tell us that will happen probably by the end of March.

That\u2019s because the anxious parent gains a sense of control from taking action rather than remaining helpless on the sidelines, but the child is still left feeling ineffectual and stressed.\n\nIt can be hard for parents to let children do more, and perhaps mess up, when a parent could do a task more quickly and effectively. But the pandemic has lowered the stakes in some common family situations. For example, when kids are doing remote learning and don\u2019t have to catch the bus, they can take on responsibility for waking themselves up. If the child oversleeps, the parents aren\u2019t stuck playing chauffeur; only the child will experience the natural consequences of lateness, Mr. Johnson said, making it easier for parents to let go of some control.\n\nWith everyone spending more time at home, families can share tasks more readily, too, even if they\u2019re not done perfectly. A preschooler with a broom may not necessarily be cleaning the floor well, but the child feels that efficacy-building sense of accomplishment and helpfulness when they are encouraged to try it for themselves, Mr. Johnson said, and \u201cthe experience of coping increases.\u201d\n\nIf this all sounds like too much work in a pandemic, remember that parents who encourage their children\u2019s strengths and self-efficacy not only help their kids, but also themselves. \u201cParents are really depleted,\u201d Dr. Waters acknowledged, but a positive, proactive approach is \u201ckind of a win-win. It\u2019s good for your kids,\u201d and seeing children thrive is \u201cgood for us as parents as well,\u201d she said. And her research has found that using a strengths-building approach \u2014 finding areas where your kids can take on more responsibility \u2014 is also correlated with an increase in parental self-efficacy, a sense that \u201cyou are doing the right thing as a parent.\u201d\n\nCourtney E. Ackerman, author of several positive psychology books, also counsels parents not to wait until the present crisis is over to instill more self-efficacy in children. Yes, working on developing resilience in these unpredictable times may feel like shoveling while the snow is still falling, she said, but that\u2019s OK. \u201cI think it\u2019s always snowing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a specifically difficult time now with the pandemic, but life is full of ups and downs.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/29/well/00well-kids-chores/00well-kids-chores-facebookJumbo.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9611175656318665}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Research has shown that when parents jump in to help kids with a frustrating problem , that intervention can lower parent anxiety while leaving the child \u2019s anxiety elevated , Mr. Johnson said.

While that projection did not include Mr. Biden\u2019s stimulus proposal, Democrats viewed the report as giving them room to borrow more money given that it projected a rosier longer-run economic picture than last fall.\n\nThe anticipated economic improvement flows from an economy that is recovering faster than officials previously expected, thanks to the ability of American businesses to adapt to the coronavirus pandemic and trillions in economic aid that lawmakers approved last year, including $900 billion in December. The budget office estimated that a quicker rebound from the depths of recession would bring in more tax revenues and increase the overall amount of goods and services churned out by the American economy, compared with its earlier forecasts.\n\nMr. Biden and his party want to borrow trillions more this year in hopes of arresting the pandemic more quickly and fueling an even stronger surge of economic growth.

At the retail level, that could be through getting them to plug their electric vehicles into Shell\u2019s growing network of 60,000 charging points, or providing a filling spot for vehicles running on hydrogen, a clean fuel that Shell has promoted for years and is gaining favor.\n\nShell also aims to use its large energy trading unit and other abilities to supply businesses with clean electricity and other lower carbon fuels and help them with other needs.

She was a marvellous person, intelligent, everything. It was a package. Everything you would find in Eudy. Jokingly she was playing, teasing others. That is what I miss about her.\"\n\nOn 27 April 2008, Simelane's body was found in a stream just a few hundred metres from her home in Kwa-Thema.\n\nReports stated she was approached after leaving a pub, raped and then stabbed repeatedly.\n\nDespite her death shocking many, activists claimed many lesbians in South Africa were targeted for 'corrective rape', a crime where the perpetrator aims to 'cure' the victim of their sexuality, converting them to heterosexuality.\n\nThato Mphuthi external-link pleaded guilty to the rape and murder of Simelane in February 2009 and was sentenced to 32 years in prison. The following September, Themba Mvubu was also found guilty of the crimes and was sentenced to life in prison. When questioned by reporters in court, he responded: \"I'm not sorry.\"\n\n'It opened the eyes of many'\n\nEudy Simelane's mother Mally fought to change perceptions of LGBT+ people before her death in 2019\n\nSimelane's sexuality put her in a vulnerable position, something her mother recognised, telling the BBC, \"the whole of South Africa knew Eudy was a lesbian\".\n\nThe unfortunate reality is Simelane's story isn't unique - she is one of many victims of similar, horrific crimes in South Africa.\n\nA year prior to her death, Sizakele Sigasa external-link , a women's and gay rights activist, and her friend Salone Massooa, were heckled outside a bar and called 'tomboys'. The women were then gang raped, tortured, and shot dead.\n\nJust a few years after Simelane's murder, Noxolo Nogwaza, a 24-year-old lesbian, was found beaten and stoned to death in the same township Simelane lived.\n\nHowever, as a country, South Africa was at the forefront of same-sex rights and became the first African nation to decriminalise same-sex acts in 1998.\n\nThe country also legalised same-sex marriage in 2006, seven years before the act was passed in the UK, and two years prior to Simelane's tragic death.\n\nDespite this, the country still has the highest number of recorded rape cases per capita external-link . Within this, it's young, black, lesbian women that often fall victim to violent 'corrective rape' crimes in South African townships.\n\nAccording to data released in 2017, external-link 49% of black members of LGBT+ communities in the country are likely to know someone who has been murdered for being LGBT+, compared to 26% of white community members.\n\nMore often than not, the perpetrators of these awful attacks are not prosecuted for their actions. external-link\n\nHuman rights activists and supporters of Eudy Simelane in August 2009 outside the Delmas court in Mpumalanga, before the trial\n\nSimelane's case has been an exception though. Her profile and story captivated the nation and brought the issue of 'corrective rape' to attention.\n\nFollowing Simelane's death, her mother Mally was instrumental in the fight to change her communities' views on homosexuality, using her Methodist faith as a platform. She united with her local Pastor, Smadz Matsepe, in a fight to change attitudes towards LGBT+ individuals in society. Mally was fully committed to fighting prejudice until her passing in 2019.\n\n\"It opened the eyes of many and it challenged us to deal with the LGBT+ issue,\" Matsepe told the BBC.\n\nA bridge was built over the stream in Kwa-Thema, next to the football field where Simelane's body was found. The bridge features her face imprinted on it and was built \"as a reminder of the freedom, dignity and equality for all\", according to the Lesbian and Gay Equality Project in The Times. external-link\n\nAnother initiative set up with the aim of changing social attitudes, was The Eudy Simelane Memorial Lecture. This annual lecture, in partnership between the Ujamaa Centre external-link at The University of KwaZulu-Natal, The Other Foundation external-link , Pietermaritzburg Gay & Lesbian Network external-link , the KwaZulu Natal Christian Council, and Simelane's family, aims to change attitudes towards LGBT+ people, particularly within some religious communities.\n\nThese bodies recognised that for there to be a significant social change, religious communities needed to adopt a new outlook on same-sex relationships and marriage, so that individuals could not try to use religious grounds to justify violence against LGBT+ people.\n\nProfessor Charlene van der Walt from the University of KwaZulu-Natal and Deputy Director of Ujamaa Centre told the BBC this year: \"Eudy's story is an example of what happens to a lot of families and a lot of faith communities, yet the issue of LGBT+ people in faith is often denied or invisible.\"\n\nThe lecture is also an opportunity to stimulate conversations around LGBT+ communities.\n\nVan der Walt added it was especially important to continue these conversation during the Covid-19 pandemic where LGBT+ people are \"vulnerable\" because they often are \"in a family setting that doesn't accept\" their sexuality.\n\n\"We have made a massive leap in the right direction,\" she said.\n\nIn the 2020 lecture, Simelane's brother Bafana, said: \"History repeats itself, so now, this lecture is eye opening to the community and other families that they must not take it as a curse if someone is gay, lesbian or transgender\".\n\nDespite the tragic death of Simelane, it sent an important message across South Africa and was a catalyst for these projects and conversations to take place.\n\nIf you've been affected by issues raised in this article, there is information and support available on BBC Action Line.", "meta_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/624/cpsprodpb/17464/production/_116923359_eudysimelanesquare.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9582720398902893}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "But because of her sexuality , Simelane was brutally raped and murdered in 2008 , aged just 31. \n\n She was one of the first openly gay women to live in her township of Kwa - Thema in South Africa and was a well - known LGBT+ activist."}, "category": "World"}, {"id": "884c05d4-64b0-475e-80fd-ca2359c1923c", "source": "bbc", "data": {"title": "Impeachment: Three key arguments by Trump\u2019s lawyers", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56052477", "description": "On the fourth day of the impeachment trial, the former president\u2019s defence set out their case.", "published": "Sat, 13 Feb 2021 08:34:36 GMT", "body": "On the fourth day of the impeachment trial, the former president\u2019s defence set out their case.\n\nThey argued that the article of impeachment was an act of \u2018political vengeance\u2019.

This has been approved in the UK and Europe.\n\nIt is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures.\n\nAll three are supposed to be given as two doses, but the UK is prioritising giving as many people as possible the first dose and delaying the second.\n\nJanssen and Novavax\n\nResults from large-scale trials on two new vaccines have also been presented recently.\n\nThe work by Janssen, which is owned by Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax will now be reviewed by drugs regulators before their jabs can be approved.\n\nJanssen's vaccine uses the same technique as Oxford, but crucially is given as a single injection, rather than two. This, combined with it needing only a fridge to store and a billion doses planned this year, means it could make a significant impact around the world.\n\nNovavax is using a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body.\n\nWhat is the rest of the world doing?\n\nThere are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US.\n\nThe Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection.\n\nThe Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according to late stage trial results published in The Lancet.

The second he claimed to have smashed \"miles and miles and miles\".\n\nNow, while all golfers are prone to hyperbole, Shepard, who was commander of Nasa's Apollo 14 mission, could well have hit his ball that far on 6 February 1971 - despite only using a makeshift six iron that he had fashioned out of a collapsible tool designed to scoop lunar rock samples, and which he had sneaked aboard in a sock.\n\nThe clubhead Shepard sneaked on board Apollo 14 in a sock and the implement he attached it to - this image is reproduced courtesy of the United States Golf Association which has the item in its museum as part of the Moon shot collection\n\nThe only footage that exists is grainy video shot side-on from one television camera. And there was no ball-tracking technology.\n\nBut imaging specialist Andy Saunders has digitally enhanced recent high-resolution scans of the original photographic film, and applied a stacking technique on smaller 16mm 'movie' footage shot by the crew.\n\nAnd not only did he manage to find the second ball, which had not been seen in 50 years, he also worked out how far it actually went.\n\nThe Moon's reduced gravity would certainly have helped and Saunders says big-hitting US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau could, theoretically, blast a ball 3.41 miles in the rarefied air - pretty much the length of an 18-hole golf course - with a hangtime of one minute and 22 seconds, were he to take his quest for more distance to extreme lengths.\n\nSo, how far did Shepard manage to hit his ball?\n\n\"Looked like a slice to me, Al,\" quipped Fred Haise in Mission Control after watching Shepard's first shot that he hit into a nearby crater. Given the known location of the TV camera, Shepard's bootprints can be identified, showing his stance for his first two attempts - when he took \"more dirt than ball\".\n\n\"We can now fairly accurately determine that ball number one travelled 24 yards, and ball number two travelled 40 yards,\" says Cheshire-based Saunders, who has been working with the United States Golf Association (USGA) external-link to mark the anniversary.\n\n\"Unfortunately, even the impressive second shot could hardly be described as 'miles and miles and miles', but of course this has only ever been regarded as a light-hearted exaggeration.\"\n\nUsing a known scale from images taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, a spacecraft launched in 2009 that took this photo in 2011, the point between divot and ball can then be measured.\n\nWhile those distances may appear underwhelming, it is still an astonishing feat by Shepard, who in 1961 was the first American to travel into space, a decade before he became the fifth man to walk on the moon.\n\n\"The moon is effectively one giant, unraked, rock-strewn bunker,\" continues Saunders.\n\n\"The pressurised suits severely restricted movement, and due to their helmet's visors they struggled to even see their feet.\n\n\"I would challenge any club golfer to go to their local course and try to hit a six-iron, one-handed, with a one-quarter swing out of an unraked bunker.\n\n\"Then imagine being fully suited, helmeted and wearing thick gloves. Remember also that there was little gravity to pull the clubhead down toward the ball.\n\n\"The fact that Shepard even made contact and got the ball airborne is extremely impressive.\"\n\nMovie footage from the Lunar Module in 1971 was used to identify both balls. The 'Javelin' was a pole from a solar wind experiment, hurled by crewmate Edgar Mitchell", "meta_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/624/cpsprodpb/14E61/production/_116810658_shepard.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9979994297027588}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The clubhead Shepard sneaked on board Apollo 14 in a sock and the implement he attached it to - this image is reproduced courtesy of the United States Golf Association which has the item in its museum as part of the Moon shot collection \n\n The only footage that exists is grainy video shot side - on from one television camera. \n\n Now , while all golfers are prone to hyperbole , Shepard , who was commander of Nasa 's Apollo 14 mission , could well have hit his ball that far on 6 February 1971 - despite only using a makeshift six iron that he had fashioned out of a collapsible tool designed to scoop lunar rock samples , and which he had sneaked aboard in a sock."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "577da6e9-f12c-47b6-b621-ae5e36ef8640", "source": "bbc", "data": {"title": "Groundbreaking biofuel rocket could be 'Uber for space'", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55845762", "description": "Stardust 1.0 has become the first commercial launch of a rocket powered by bio-derived fuel.", "published": "Mon, 01 Feb 2021 05:26:34 GMT", "body": "\"Right now there are freight trains to space like SpaceX and ULA - and there are buses to space, like medium size rockets,\" says Deri. \"They're taking thousands of kilograms to space.

It would also mean missing out on much of the jobs boom the sector is expected to bring.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis could be a game changer when it comes to jobs, but we have to find a way to ensure we keep the technology in the U.S. and incentivize companies to produce it in the U.S.,\u201d said Venkat Srinivasan, a top battery expert at Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, Ill.\n\nThat will happen, say U.S. companies and clean-energy supporters, only if the federal government helps coordinate and finance an aggressive push to boost domestic manufacturing of batteries and their raw materials, as governments in China, South Korea and Europe are doing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re naive to pretend this will happen without government dynamism and action,\u201d says Danny Kennedy, CEO of New Energy Nexus, a nonprofit in Oakland, Calif., that funds and advises start-ups.\n\nThe calls are part of a renewed embrace of industrial policy to help the United States keep its technological edge in an increasingly competitive global economy. Backers of federal action say that without it, the United States risks losing out on another major technology boom \u2014 as it did with solar panels and 5G mobile network equipment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThanks to its federally funded universities and national labs, the United States has some of the best early-stage battery research in the world. It also has Tesla, an electric-car leader with big plans for domestic battery production. But other countries are doing far more to support their battery industries and ensure that production jobs stay local.\n\nChina is bolstering its battery and electric-vehicle companies with tens of billions of dollars of state support, including research and development funding, subsidies for manufacturers and financing for battery-charging stations. It has also driven demand by subsidizing consumer purchases of electric vehicles, and by making buyers of gasoline-fueled cars wait much longer for a license plate.\n\nThe European Union is also closely involved in supporting its battery sector, having established a European Battery Alliance in 2017 that set sweeping goals for manufacturing, charging infrastructure and electric-car uptake. Germany is requiring all gas stations to offer electric-car charging. And last month, the European Commission said it would spend $3.5 billion to subsidize Tesla, BMW and other companies to produce more batteries in Europe and help cut imports from China.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, the United States offered federal loan guarantees to support clean-energy companies including Tesla, which is now one of the world\u2019s most valuable auto companies. It also introduced a $7,500 tax credit for electric-car purchases, but the perk was limited to 200,000 cars per manufacturer, which Tesla and GM have already exhausted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome of this federal support dried up during the Trump administration, under withering criticism from conservatives, who dismissed clean energy as a liberal priority.\n\nAside from California, which has adopted many incentives and regulations to boost electric vehicles and renewable energy, the United States has largely left the sector to the free market.\n\nPresident Biden has said he will \u201cuse all the levers of the federal government, from purchasing power, R&D, tax, trade, and investment policies\u201d to \u201cposition America to be the global leader in the manufacture of electric vehicles and their input materials.\u201d\n\nHe took a first step by signing an executive order calling on government agencies, including the U.S. Postal Service, to start converting their fleets to electric vehicles. He\u2019s also pledged to build 500,000 charging stations, revise and extend tax credits for buyers and tighten fuel economy standards for gas-powered vehicles, which the Trump administration relaxed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd his Cabinet members and nominees have stressed the need to act quickly to create clean-energy jobs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d better believe China is in this game. They are competing aggressively,\u201d former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, Biden\u2019s nominee for energy secretary, told a Senate hearing on Jan. 27. \u201cWithout a federal partner to make sure we can get these jobs in America then we will be losing globally.\u201d\n\nIn a meeting with senators Thursday to discuss infrastructure investment, Biden warned about the need to compete more effectively with China. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get moving, they\u2019re going to eat our lunch,\u201d he said. Also Thursday, the Department of Energy announced up to $100 million of new funding for clean-energy research.\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans have long expressed skepticism about government involvement in the economy and heaped criticism on the Obama administration when a solar-panel company failed after receiving a federal loan guarantee. But some have started to support more government intervention as necessary for competing with China.\n\nDoug Campbell, co-founder of battery start-up Solid Power in Louisville, Colo., said the United States should boost tax breaks and other financial support for companies building manufacturing plants.\n\n\u201cOne thing we do great here is innovate,\u201d said Campbell, whose company was spun out of the University of Colorado. \u201cBut where there is a chasm is when it gets to manufacturing scale. That is where other nations step in and provide some of that capital before a bank is willing to lean in.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe added, \u201cWe can choose to step in and entice industry and growth, or we cannot and run the risk that we are ceding all of this overseas.\u201d Solid Power so far has established a limited manufacturing line to produce thousands of cells a year, which automakers including Ford and BMW are testing.\n\nLithium-ion batteries grew out of research that won the 2019 Nobel Prize in chemistry. The powerful, rechargeable batteries first appeared in Sony camcorders in the early 1990s and are now used in everything from smartphones and laptops to electric vehicles.\n\nThey are also crucial for harnessing renewable energy, allowing power companies to store solar and wind energy for use when the sun goes down and the wind stops blowing. Cars, buses and power companies use large battery packs containing thousands of individual battery cells.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Pentagon is \u201cvery interested in electrifying\u201d as a means to lower its fuel costs, said Sam Jaffe, a battery expert at Cairn Energy Research Advisors in Boulder, Colo. Drones and other electronic gear are already battery-powered, and in the future ships and aircraft may be, too, he said.\n\nThat heightens the need for strong domestic production, said William Acker, executive director of NY-BEST, a nonprofit promoting the battery sector in New York.\n\n\u201cIf all of our batteries are coming from Asia and you need them to conduct military operations, that\u2019s a very concerning situation,\u201d Acker said.\n\nTesla and its Japanese partner, Panasonic, manufacture lithium-ion battery cells at a giant factory in Nevada. At Tesla\u2019s \u201cBattery Day\u201d presentation in September, CEO Elon Musk said the company was preparing to build a new battery-cell factory that would dramatically increase output and cut costs.\n\nMusk didn\u2019t say where the plant would be located, but in January Tesla tweeted job postings for battery production at Giga Texas, the new auto factory Tesla is building near Austin.\n\nMusk also said Tesla would begin extracting lithium from a deposit in Nevada to supply the new battery factory. He said the mining would involve using salt to extract lithium from heaps of dirt, and then returning the dirt to its original place, a process he called \u201cenvironmentally friendly.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTesla\u2019s goal is to exert control over the whole battery supply chain, from base battery materials to the building of battery cells, to their installation directly into Tesla\u2019s cars, Musk and other Tesla executives said at Battery Day.\n\nGeneral Motors and its partner, South Korea\u2019s LG Chem, began building a battery-cell plant in Lordstown, Ohio, last summer that will eventually create 1,100 jobs. The factory is part of GM\u2019s big push to stop selling gas-powered cars and switch to electric by 2035, which the automaker promoted with a Super Bowl ad starring Will Ferrell.\n\nThe Chinese company Envision Group gained control of a lithium-ion battery plant in Smyrna, Tenn., after acquiring the battery business of Japan\u2019s Nissan in 2019. The factory makes batteries for a nearby Nissan Leaf plant.\n\nAnd South Korea\u2019s SK Innovation is building two lithium-ion battery factories in Commerce, Ga.\n\nAD\n\nTo maximize job creation and to ensure the United States has a secure supply of batteries, it needs to develop the industries that mine and refine the materials needed for production, including lithium, says Kennedy, the head of New Energy Nexus. At the moment, China dominates much of the trade of these materials.\n\nThe United Nations warned in a report last year that some battery-related mining has caused environmental damage. Much of the world\u2019s current lithium supply comes from Latin America, where some mining has caused groundwater depletion, soil contamination and other forms of environmental degradation, the report said.\n\nThe U.N. called the global boom in electric vehicles \u201cgreat news\u201d for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but said industry should invest in greener mining techniques and better ways to recycle materials from spent batteries.\n\nKennedy and others point to a fledgling project in Southern California called Lithium Valley, which seeks to extract the mineral from the Salton Sea.\n\nSupporters of the project say the lithium could be extracted in an environmentally friendly manner, as a byproduct of geothermal energy production already underway in the area. The California Energy Commission has expressed interest in the idea, and has given grants for further study of the project. California also set up a commission to study the environmental impact.\n\nCalifornia is the largest market in the United States for electric vehicles and energy-storage batteries for power grids, \u201cand now we\u2019d like to do more manufacturing of the intermediate steps,\u201d David Hochschild, chair of the California Energy Commission, said in an interview. \u201cWe have the end use of electric vehicles and energy storage, and we have the raw materials, so the vision of Lithium Valley is to get the full supply chain.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JDOCDDDKEYI6XJTO4JYEN2PITA.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9990578293800354}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "That would leave the United States dependent on China and other trading partners for much of its battery supply , a risky proposition not just for the auto industry but for the military , which is planning to electrify more of its vehicles and gear.

But the show has maintained its relevance, in the fall winning the Emmy for outstanding variety talk series for a fifth straight year. Oliver, who ended his seventh season in November by \u201cblowing up\u201d 2020, returns with a new season Sunday. The Washington Post talked with him by Zoom. (The conversation has been lightly edited for brevity.)\n\nSo it\u2019s been a quiet few months since you last had a show.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRun of the mill, really.\n\nWhat did you think as you were watching the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6? Besides \u201cI wish I was on the air right now.\u201d\n\nIt was kind of the opposite of that, actually. I was really glad not to be on the air. Because sometimes it's nice not to have to fiddle while Rome burns.\n\nWhat did cross your mind?\n\nThe initial reactions along the lines of \u201cthis just seems unimaginable.\u201d Which just seems \u2026 not accurate. It\u2019s not just actively imaginable \u2014 it was literally predictable. \u201cIt\u2019s unimaginable\u201d comes from a place of such naive, willfully blind comfort. It\u2019s dangerous to think \u201cthis could not happen here\u201d when we all watched in real time the buildup to exactly that.\n\nAD\n\nAre we equally naive then in your view to think we\u2019re out of the woods now [in terms of unrest]?\n\nOf course. The dangerous thing is the optimistic reaction Biden tends to have a lot, which is \u201cthis is not who were are.\u201d You understand why he says that because it makes people feel better. But it probably makes them feel a little too much better. Because the tenth time you say \u201cthis is not who we are\u201d it might be a little bit who we actually are.\n\nAD\n\nSome suggest with Trump out of office a time of disquiet has passed. Yet in many ways it feels like it\u2019s just beginning \u2014 the contretemps over Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s comments recently, for example.\n\nThere\u2019s going to be a long tail to that process and I think it will become clearer and clearer the extent to which he [Trump] has set a new course for the Republican Party. It\u2019s not just Marjorie Taylor Greene \u2014 there\u2019s plenty of other people with very dangerous views. But the idea that we\u2019re closing a chapter of American history \u2014 that\u2019s just not how history works. Those chapters tend not to exist in [expletive] isolation.\n\nWhat\u2019s going to be your approach on Trump now \u2014 do you want the show to lean in to anything he does? Or is it your belief that will be giving him what he wants?\n\nAD\n\nThat was always the internal calculation you made with him as president. He\u2019s a guy who wants attention more than anything else. So it\u2019s working out \u201cwhen is it irresponsible to give him that attention\u201d and \u201cwhen is it actively irresponsible to ignore him.\u201d We managed to keep the body of our show intact from him most of the time. We spend weeks on our main story. So for us there were key calculations in \u201cdo we still do what we\u2019re planning to do or do we respond to what he\u2019s just done?\u201d The majority of time was let\u2019s keep going. There were definitely moments when it was \u201cno, we\u2019re going to throw that show out.\u201d A really visceral example was his reaction to Jamal Khashoggi being murdered. It felt like there was nothing else that week.\n\nAD\n\nI think the calculation will be similar when he\u2019s out of office. When is it a good idea to ignore him? Which will be a lot of the time. And when would it be reckless not to address what just happened. But I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll be a significantly diminished figure \u2014 [I hope] that both as a human being and as someone who writes comedy.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, I asked Steve Bodow, your former colleague at \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d about what it would mean for late-night comedians not to have Trump in office, and he said they\u2019d not only be \u201cpolitically and patriotically happier, but they\u2019ll be comedically happier.\u201d The idea that late-night wants what Trump provides, he says, is a myth.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a complete myth and it\u2019s kind of genuinely insulting. [Laughs] Wow, how little do you think of me? Because partly it comes from \u201coh, it must\u2019ve written itself.\u201d Really? You [expletive] think that? You try injecting poison into your body every week and get a joke out the other side that Twitter hasn\u2019t already come up with. The happiest I was at the end of last year was we finished our final show and started working on our new list of shows. And it was just great to be able to think about wonky stories.\n\nAD\n\nTrump so much wanted to make every story about him. He\u2019s often not the key part of every story; the systemic problems underneath were there before him and will remain after him. That gets to your point \u2014 it\u2019s the danger of thinking we closed that chapter. Not really.\n\nWhat might some of those problems and wonky stories be?\n\nAD\n\nThe long gestating problems this virus has shone a spotlight on that have been ignored for a long time. Human history has shown we\u2019re pretty adept at choosing to forget about them again as soon as it\u2019s convenient. So I think the virus will be an interesting hook into some interesting stories this year.\n\nBecause it touches on everything \u2014 health care, racial inequity, class inequity.\n\nAnd even our division. What a virus needs more than anything else is a collective effort, and at the best of times America has an individualistic side, which is not particularly suited to that. And right now it\u2019s, of course, even worse because it\u2019s being politicized. The virus touches every side of human life and has exposed all the weaknesses of American society.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFrom an entertainment-consumption standpoint, what\u2019s something you think will be very different at the end of this? Or are we going to go back to exactly how things were?\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to project, because to go back a year is to go back to a different world. I haven\u2019t seen my staff in nearly a year. I haven\u2019t heard human laughter since mid-March. The thing I can\u2019t imagine is being in front of an audience. I can\u2019t imagine how that\u2019s going to feel. But it\u2019s so hard to project what the other side of this will look like. Especially because systemically and politically, a return to normal is not what we should be aiming for.\n\nYou blew up 2020 in your last episode in November. Are you ready to blow up 2021 yet?

Now HUD officials say the agency will administer the law to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n\u201cWhat the Biden administration is doing now is incredibly important, doing right by some of the most marginalized people in the United States who need access to federal housing programs,\u201d said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. \u201cWhat\u2019s really significant about it is they are using the Fair Housing Act, which is what we think the [Supreme Court] decision would require.\u201d\n\nUnder the Trump administration, HUD introduced a proposal to allow federally funded homeless shelters to deny people admission on religious grounds or force transgender women to share bathrooms and sleeping quarters with men.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFormer HUD secretary Ben Carson angered agency staff and civil rights advocates when he expressed concern about \u201cbig, hairy men\u201d trying to infiltrate women\u2019s shelters during an internal meeting at HUD\u2019s San Francisco office in 2019.\n\nCarson often justified the reversal of Obama-era protections by saying he believes in equal rights, not \u201cspecial rights,\u201d and said he had received complaints of men who pretend to be women to gain access to battered women\u2019s shelters. (Transgender advocates called Carson\u2019s defense a common, damaging and insulting trope that had long been debunked.)\n\nThe Trump administration not only eroded fair housing protections for transgender people and other groups, but it also rarely enforced existing law. Civil rights and housing advocates have recommended that Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), Biden\u2019s HUD nominee, reinstate and expand those protections.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, after consulting with the White House and Department of Justice, HUD officials say they have determined that the Fair Housing Act bars discrimination based on gender identification and sexual orientation and will enforce the law to combat such biases. They said the new guidance was necessary because studies have shown same-sex couples and transgender people experience less favorable treatment than their straight and cisgender counterparts when seeking rental housing.\n\nThe agency will accept and investigate complaints from people who think they have been subject to housing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity going back to Jan. 20, 2020, one year before Biden\u2019s executive order. HUD officials said the fair housing office has received about 200 complaints alleging discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation in the past year, but expect those numbers to rise as people are made aware of the agency\u2019s new enforcement policy.\n\nIn a call with reporters, HUD officials characterized Thursday\u2019s action as the first step the Biden administration is taking to uphold LGBTQ rights and said future announcements can be expected.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AJGGOVTHDAI6XOVYOB7YO2OXQU.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.998954176902771}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The 2012 Equal Access Rule barred federally funded housing programs from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

Adhering to coronavirus countermeasures \u2014 using masks, getting tested and maintaining social distance \u2014 are as much a reflection of concern for others as they are of self-preservation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt stands to reason, then, that stronger, more connected and more trusting communities would have more success weathering the pandemic. This is the idea motivating the recent paper by Christos Makridis of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Cary Wu of York University in Toronto. Their work assesses whether the level of social capital in a community predicts the severity of the pandemic there.\n\nSocial capital refers to \u201cfeatures of social organization, such as networks, norms, and trust, that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit,\u201d as defined by legendary political scientist Robert Putnam. In communities with large reserves of social capital, people trust their institutions and their neighbors. They belong to civic organizations such as churches, Elks clubs and bowling leagues. They help each other in times of crisis.\n\nFor their paper, Makridis and Wu used a social capital index previously developed by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee. That index combines dozens of individual data points \u2014 including family structure, parental behaviors, social ties, political engagement, trust in institutions, crime and charitable giving \u2014 to assess social capital at the county level.\n\nThe committee\u2019s report identifies two U.S. regions where social capital is high: what it calls the \u201cmid-continent North,\u201d stretching roughly from Utah to the upper Midwestern states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, and the northern New England states of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne defining feature of all 12 states in these regions: They\u2019re sparsely populated, home to just 9 percent of the U.S. population. Surveys have shown that people living in rural communities are generally more trusting of their friends and neighbors than people elsewhere, which can help build strong social networks. Some scholars who study social capital contend that in sparsely populated rural communities, \u201ccollective behavior is essential to provide basic services, like volunteer fire departments, that are provided by government in urban areas.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the southern half of the country performs particularly poorly on the committee\u2019s index. New York also stands out for low levels of social capital relative to its neighbors.\n\nMakridis and Wu compared the committee\u2019s social capital index score with county-level data on coronavirus infections, case growth and mortality. They controlled for a number of other factors that could plausibly influence severity, including population density, age, education and poverty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe find that moving a county from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the distribution of social capital would lead to a 18% and 5.7% decline in the cumulative number of infections and deaths,\u201d they write.\n\nThey found, moreover, that the relationship between social capital and covid-19 severity persists even when factoring alternative measures of social capital, including one that uses census response rates as a proxy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMakridis and Wu also broke down the committee\u2019s social capital index to determine which element is most closely related to covid-19 severity. They found that \u201cgreater trust and relationships within a community\u201d were some of the most powerful predictors of virus spread. \u201cWhen individuals have a greater concern for others, they are more willing to follow hygienic practices and social distancing.\u201d\n\nConversely, in places with low social capital, people tend to be distrustful of the government, making them less likely to comply with social distancing and mask mandates. This can create a type of vicious cycle, Makridis and Wu write: Lack of compliance with public health directives leads to more severe outbreaks, which causes trust in government to erode further.\n\nOther data, like the ongoing pandemic behavior survey conducted by Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Delphi Group, shows that vaccine hesitancy is high in states with low social capital, particularly in the South.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile the data analyzed only goes through July, Makridis said in an interview that he and Wu don\u2019t expect the relationship to change much over time. \u201cWhen there are surges, that seems to be when social capital matters the most,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the peak of the crisis in April, that\u2019s when we found the greatest effect of social capital on the virus.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BEWG7GW2KNB3XBFZM3YH5FZVIY.png&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9684076905250549}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Their work assesses whether the level of social capital in a community predicts the severity of the pandemic there.

You can\u2019t work here if you cannot lift a certain amount of weight, so I think she may have omitted information about her injury to get hired.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI am a licensed professional and need to be able to trust my colleagues. Normally, I would give someone the benefit of the doubt, but I was burned by Wanda and am already stressed about her being here.\n\nShould I give HR a heads-up that Wanda and I have a past, just to get it on the record? If I try to discuss the past with her, I might get in trouble for harassment.\n\nKarla: It can be tempting to see a history like Wanda\u2019s as an indictment of her integrity. But the only evidence I see of her burning you is when she took advantage of your generosity as your roommate/squatter. Even then, I could see her making a plausible case that you both understood the terms of your arrangement differently, or that she was desperate and contributed as much as she could.\n\nAD\n\nThe other information you provide about Wanda could be interpreted to paint her as anything from a deliberate, habitual grifter to a hapless victim of a series of compounding setbacks who\u2019s had to rely on the legal system and the kindness of others to try to get back on her feet.\n\nAD\n\nMore to the point, legal actions that didn\u2019t directly involve you, secondhand observations about how \u201cdisabled\u201d she truly was, and your suspicions about how she got this job are all hearsay and speculation.

In any case, going to HR or trying to confront Wanda directly with what you (think you) know about the past will almost certainly backfire.\n\nBut you can use what you (think you) know about Wanda to set your own risk tolerance threshold for your interactions with her in the present.\n\nAD\n\nAside from whether Wanda herself is trustworthy, you know you can\u2019t leave room for misunderstanding or differing interpretation with her.

The rest comes from walk-ins with special requests such as a bridal gown or antique rug.\n\nThe business has two full-time seamstresses who replace buttons, stitch up tears and do full alterations.\n\nParkway\u2019s marketing targets upscale neighborhoods such as Chevy Chase, McLean and Potomac, where clients demand \u2014 and are willing to pay for \u2014 customized treatment for their belongings.\n\n\u201cIf I see a house that sells for over $1.5 million, we would mail them a coupon and say we would love to be your dry cleaner,\u201d Simon said. \u201cIf they can afford a $1 million house, they probably dress well.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSimon uses bar codes to record his customers\u2019 preferences, such as whether they want their sweater draped over a hanger or a crease in their pants. \u201cIt\u2019s a labor-intensive business,\u201d he said.\n\nParkway relies on a crew of skilled longtime employees to deliver specialized service. \u201cWe spot- and hand-clean garments before we insert it into the dry-cleaning machine,\u201d he said. \u201cMost cleaners don\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nThat kind of detail isn\u2019t cheap. A laundered shirt that might cost 99 cents to clean at a competitor starts around $4 at Parkway. The average order, which can include multiple items, is about $35. Simon\u2019s troops clean more than 100,000 pieces a year.\n\nHigher volume at higher prices helped propel Parkway to nearly $4 million a year in revenue and a mid-six-figure income for its owner before the coronavirus pandemic hit. Simon said most dry cleaners consider $1 million in sales a very good year, but many finish at half that number.\n\nHis 25 employees account for half his costs. The rest is rent and utilities, then insurance, marketing and other expenses. His operation also includes five vehicles.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen the shutdowns came in March, revenue tumbled by about two-thirds before climbing back. The company finished the year with about $3 million in revenue, roughly breaking even.\n\n\u201cWeddings, proms, dinners and regular workplace suits and dresses came to a hard stop,\u201d Simon said. \u201cAlmost nobody is wearing many, if any, clothes that require dry cleaning. There are no large gatherings. There have been no gala fundraisers and balls. And of course no inaugural parties and events.\u201d\n\nSimon\u2019s experience in manufacturing came into play during the pandemic when he re-engineered his factory floor, reassigning his seamstresses to sew masks.\n\n\u201cWe got into making hand-sewn masks before the major manufacturers and overseas suppliers could catch up,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nThe federal government helped him during the downturn with $250,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program. Simon applied for an additional $250,000 in the next round of relief.\n\nAD\n\nSimon, who has an engineering degree from the University of Michigan and a master\u2019s degree from Harvard Business School, calls dry cleaning \u201cthe most challenging industry I have been involved in.\u201d\n\nIt is a canvas for his computer skills and wonky management ideas. During one tour, he proudly pointed to his desktop computer, where he can track his drivers at any given moment, knowing how many deliveries they have made and how many remain.\n\nHe is at the shop every day, often until late in the evening.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy holy grail is management by wandering around,\u201d he said. \u201cAn absentee owner in this business is a recipe for failure or, at best, mediocrity.\u201d\n\nPaying close attention to detail has helped reduce mistakes from 5 percent to well below 1 percent, he said. With fewer mistakes and ruined items of clothing, his insurance costs dropped.\n\nAD\n\nTo improve quality, Simon recently invested $50,000 to upgrade the computer system and install newer cleaning equipment.\n\n\u201cThe investment can impact your cash flow short term, but in the long run this pays off in being able to charge more and retain employees,\u201d Simon said. More than half of his 25 employees have been with him for the 20 years he has owned the business.\n\nSimon was forced to move from his longtime Connecticut Avenue headquarters to the North Bethesda location because his landlord wanted to develop the property.\n\nAD\n\nSimon spent several million dollars on the move, including $1 million for new equipment and outfitting the factory\u2019s utility infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI financed it, but I went deep into my own pockets, too,\u201d Simon said.\n\nSimon grew up in Rochester, N.Y., where his grandfather founded a company that invented and manufactured plastic crystals typically found on wristwatches.\n\nAD\n\nHe intended to become a musician but decided on engineering by the time he graduated from Michigan in 1978.\n\n\u201cI always knew I would get a business degree,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pursued an MBA immediately afterward, which is unusual because most graduate business schools prefer candidates who have real-world experience.\n\n\u201cI had worked at the family factory and at places like Chrysler during college, so I think Harvard thought I had enough work experience,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nSimon wanted to strike out on his own and bounced between jobs, including a real estate title company, his own heating and air conditioning firm, a couple of Internet start-ups and computer programming.\n\nHe wanted to be his own boss, so he hired a business broker to find a company Simon could buy so he could put his own ideas to work.\n\n\u201cI told the broker, \u2018No restaurants and no retail,\u2019 \u201d Simon said. \u201cI wanted something with a unique position in the marketplace, something with a proprietary product or service.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen the broker pitched Parkway, a Washington-area institution founded in 1926, Simon nearly hung up the phone.\n\n\u201cHe convinced me to at least look at this cleaners,\u201d Simon recalled. \u201cHe told me it wasn\u2019t your typical dry cleaner.\u201d\n\nSimon paid a visit and thought the dry cleaner was ripe for innovation.\n\n\u201cAfter looking and digging in and feeling comfortable with this business having run the manufacturing part of our family business, I dove in.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XCGBYJCVEQI6XLGFSLJIDGQ4ZM.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9996479153633118}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Parkway \u2019s marketing targets upscale neighborhoods such as Chevy Chase , McLean and Potomac , where clients demand \u2014 and are willing to pay for \u2014 customized treatment for their belongings. \n\n About 75 percent of his business is based on routine pickups and deliveries to those 3,000 core customers by three full - time drivers."}, "category": "Business"}, {"id": "cdcd915d-b524-4c93-bb6a-4b3c88b4466d", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "The new corporate swag: Branded masks, sanitizer spray bottles and Zoom vanity light rings ", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/30/new-corporate-swag-branded-masks-sanitizer-spray-bottles-zoom-vanity-light-rings/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_business", "description": "For businesses such as Lemonade, whose executives appeared in branded masks for their IPO, it\u2019s a chance to demonstrate their socially conscious identity", "published": "Thu, 02 Jul 2020 03:10:33 EDT", "body": "As some businesses reopen and others try to stay in touch with employees working from home, companies are opting for coronavirus-related corporate swag \u2014 branded sanitizer bottles, \u201cclean key\u201d tools for pressing elevator buttons and, above all, masks \u2014 joining the tote bags, travel mugs and USB flash drives that have long defined company giveaways.\n\n\u201cIt feels like 70 percent of our orders has a mask in it,\u201d said Michael Martocci, founder and chief executive of SwagUp, despite not prominently promoting masks on his site. \u201cEverybody wants it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome companies, such as Dunkin\u2019 and Bloomingdale\u2019s, are selling face coverings with brands, distinctive colors or catchphrases directly to consumers, and some companies offer them to front-line employees in service jobs.

Larry Hogan, could raise $250 million to fund state education restructuring initiatives, its principal backers estimate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe looming tax has drawn sharp opposition from a wide array of businesses, including Amazon, Facebook and Google, which have lobbied through industry coalitions, including the Internet Association. The group and its allies have blitzed the airwaves with ads in recent months, and they are expected to support an imminent lawsuit to stop the tax from taking effect. They argue Maryland is prohibited under federal law from assessing such levies on Internet companies in the first place.\n\nThe clash carries immense national implications at a time when states are struggling to balance their budgets and front the ever-rising costs of a national public-health emergency. The scramble to raise new money \u2014 and the newfound interest in taxing tech \u2014 reflects a growing belief among government officials nationwide that Silicon Valley for too long has failed to share the bounty of its unrivaled economic growth.\n\n\u201cRight now, they don\u2019t contribute,\u201d said Sen. Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), the chief sponsor of Maryland\u2019s tax proposal. \u201cThese platforms that have grown fast, and so enormously, should also have to contribute to the civic infrastructure that helped them become so successful.\u201d\n\nThe renewed push in Maryland and across the country has coincided with another record-breaking earnings season in Silicon Valley and beyond. Amazon this month reported more than $125 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, marking the most lucrative three-month run in its history. Facebook raked in more than $28 billion over that same period, and Google took in nearly $57 billion, in both cases dwarfing analysts\u2019 quarterly estimates. (Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWall Street has rewarded Silicon Valley\u2019s strong returns handsomely, as these companies boast sky-high share prices that make them some of the most desirable stocks to own \u2014 and the most valuable firms in the world. But the industry\u2019s immense gains also have fueled a renewed global debate over its financial responsibilities amid the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\n\nIn France, for example, government officials in recent months have sought to tax Apple, Google and other tech behemoths anew out of a belief that they dodge their dues. The companies have opposed the new taxes, which nearly sparked a trade war between France and the United States under the Trump administration. Last month, though, then-treasury secretary nominee Janet Yellen endorsed France\u2019s calls for a global deal on taxing these firms.\n\nIn the United States, state policymakers are starting to sound a similar note: Democrats and Republicans alike have put forward a host of measures that seek to take more direct aim at Silicon Valley\u2019s bottom line. MultiState, a government relations firm that tracks local legislatures, says it is eyeing at least 17 bills in 10 states that aim to impose taxes on tech giants, their profits, the data they collect and the services they offer.\n\nKansas Gov. Laura Kelly (D) in recent days has proposed raising $97 million in new taxes that could apply to online streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu. Democratic lawmakers in Washington state, meanwhile, have sought to tax companies that sell consumers\u2019 personal data as part of a broader push this year to protect state residents\u2019 privacy online.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur tax system reflects our economy the way it was back when we achieved statehood,\u201d said state Rep. Shelley Kloba (D), citing the state\u2019s roots in industries such as forestry before Amazon and Microsoft called Washington home. \u201cOur economy doesn\u2019t look like that anymore. The collection, processing and sale or commercialization of data is really big business.\u201d\n\nNew York lawmakers have put forward a raft of similar proposals as they stare down a massive $20 billion revenue shortfall over the next four years. Others in the state have sought to return the tech industry\u2019s record-breaking profits back to the people, believing that the public should share more directly in the financial gains generated from their personal data. A bill from Sen. Kevin Thomas (D), for example, taxes tech giants to set up a new program for undergraduate students so that they can refinance their college debts at friendlier interest rates.\n\n\u201cData is the new commodity out there,\u201d said Thomas, who serves on a key tax-focused panel in Albany. \u201cIt gives companies the advantage in the market, and they make billions of dollars on it. And they\u2019re not paying a penny to the people or the state.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIndiana policymakers have eyed Facebook and other social media companies to fund investments in local infrastructure improvements. The nascent idea from Republican Rep. J.D. Prescott aims to help boost broadband buildout in the state\u2019s most rural areas, as members of the legislature seek to improve Internet access and affordability during a pandemic that has forced families to work and learn primarily online.\n\nPrescott said he and his colleagues had been \u201cthinking about what companies are really utilizing this [Internet] infrastructure, and not paying tax in the state for that infrastructure, and social media came to mind.\u201d The lawmaker likened it to truckers who pay a \u201cwheels tax\u201d for the long-haul rigs they drive on state highways to fund road repairs.\n\nMany of these proposals are in their infancy, and their Democratic and Republican backers probably will face years-long battles to navigate their states\u2019 labyrinthine legislative processes \u2014 and overcome the tech industry\u2019s formidable lobbying opposition. But experts say their success may hinge in part on the tax Maryland authorized Friday.\n\nFerguson, who first introduced the proposal, said he introduced it out of a belief it might help crack down on an industry that repeatedly has mishandled its users\u2019 personal information. Unlike regulation, which runs the risk of becoming obsolete, Ferguson said a tax on online ads could serve as a \u201cmonetary disincentive\u201d for tech giants as they further refine their powerful algorithms for targeting narrow groups of users with ads.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLawmakers since recalibrated their effort to fund education initiatives. Rep. Eric G. Luedtke (D), the majority leader in the Maryland House of Delegates, cited Europe\u2019s efforts to rethink the way it taxes tech giants as he stressed the need for states such as Maryland to collect more from businesses with the greatest economic footprints. His chamber voted to adopt the tax, and override Hogan\u2019s earlier veto, on Thursday, and the state\u2019s Senate followed a day later.\n\n\u201cIf you can imagine in the 1800s if the steel industry didn\u2019t pay taxes at all, or the 1950s if the auto industry didn\u2019t pay taxes at all ... government is not able to provide the basic services it needs to provide,\u201d Luedtke said.\n\nBut the Democrats\u2019 approach has generated fierce opposition among Amazon, Facebook, Google and a wide range of businesses, including large national employers and local firms from Maryland. They banded together last year in a group called Marylanders for Tax Fairness led by Doug Mayer, a former Hogan aide. The coalition argues the cost of Maryland\u2019s new tax ultimately will be borne by restaurants, shops and other small businesses that buy those ads in the first place.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey think they\u2019re going to hit these big out-of-state companies, and I think they\u2019re swinging and missing and hitting their own constituents,\u201d Mayer said.\n\nAmazon, Facebook and Google, which belong to trade groups that have joined the Maryland coalition, declined on Thursday to say whether they would raise their prices and pass them onto consumers once Maryland lawmakers adopted the tax. But their advocates\u2019 lobbying efforts appear to indicate higher prices are on the horizon.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be a cost that needs to be passed down the value chain,\u201d said Chris Gilrein, the executive director for Massachusetts and the Northeast at TechNet, a lobbying group that represents the three companies.\n\nMaryland lawmakers have since introduced emergency legislation that seeks to prevent them from doing so, which Mayer previously described as a form of \u201cSoviet-era price controls.\u201d The state\u2019s legislators also have sought to exempt media outlets, including The Washington Post, that had lobbied as part of an industry trade group against the tax.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome Maryland businesses are expected to file lawsuits to stop the tax from taking effect, stressing the state\u2019s proposal is unfair, discriminatory and unconstitutional. They also contend it runs afoul of a federal moratorium on taxes that exclusively target Internet companies. Congress adopted that prohibition in 2016 out of a belief that state and local governments should not be able to nickel-and-dime revenue from companies that transact across borders.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want states to be able to limit the rise of electronic commerce, tax Internet access or otherwise restrict the ability to grow out the online sphere,\u201d said Jared Walczak, the vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation.\n\nThe potential legal impediments prompted Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D) to warn state lawmakers last year that there is a risk a court could strike down the state\u2019s proposal. Walczak said the outcome of the expected lawsuits could carry great resonance, particularly in states that try to count on new, unsettled revenue from the tech industry as part of their budget plans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI expect other states to follow in Maryland\u2019s footsteps on this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be a lot of reticence because states know they will be setting themselves up for costly litigation. They don\u2019t know if they will collect the revenue because of that.\u201d\n\nEven the law\u2019s sponsors agree that the stakes are high and the outcome unclear \u2014 although Ferguson said the legal and political fight ahead is one they\u2019re more than ready to have in a quest to force the tech industry to \u201cpay its fair share.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MTV6KCSVUAI6XLGFSLJIDGQ4ZM.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.7786099314689636}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The tension has been on public display this week in Maryland , where Democrats in the state \u2019s legislature launched a first - in - the - nation tax on online advertising on Friday. \n\n AD \n\n AD \n\n The looming tax has drawn sharp opposition from a wide array of businesses , including Amazon , Facebook and Google , which have lobbied through industry coalitions , including the Internet Association."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "fc472bbe-e7ce-4fa6-8528-03614774f573", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "In Northwest Washington, a Georgian house with plenty of charm and a pedigree", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/in-northwest-washington-a-place-with-plenty-of-charm-and-a-pedigree/2021/02/11/e968e7e0-671d-11eb-886d-5264d4ceb46d_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_business", "description": "HOUSE OF THE WEEK | Owner expresses mixed feelings about leaving her \u201celegant\u201d but \u201cnot pretentious\u201d home.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 05:30:00 EST", "body": "The stately house was built in 1929 by real estate developer William A.

The basement floor was dug down, creating higher ceilings and a better living space on the lower level. Stairs to the lower level were added because the only way to reach it was by elevator. A wine storage area was also created.\n\nThe kitchen was modernized and French doors that open to the gardens were installed. The bathrooms were renovated as well.\n\nDespite all the changes, the Brockways preserved many of the original details that make the house special, such as the fireplace mantels.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really elegant house, but it\u2019s not pretentious,\u201d Marilyn said. \u201cIt\u2019s very livable.

And now that unfulfilled demand for resale homes is spurring a boom in the home-building \u00admarket.\n\nAt the start of 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic, the home-building industry was projecting 3 percent nationwide growth in single-family houses. It ended up with a more than 10 percent gain in single-family construction, said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). The growth rate was 5 percent for the Washington area. \u201cEven though it\u2019s about half the growth rate nationwide, it\u2019s still above what we expected for the year,\u201d said Dietz.\n\nAD\n\nMoreover, he added, sales of newly constructed houses rose by 18.8 percent.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI have folks who have been striking out on the resale and I\u2019ve now suggested they look at new construction,\u201d said Jan Brito, associate broker with Compass Real Estate in Chevy Chase, Md., and president of the Greater Capital Area Association of Realtors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen it this bad in 16 years. They can\u2019t build them fast enough,\u201d she added.\n\nLows and highs\n\nIn December, according to a Realtor.com report, the year-over-year supply of for-sale homes across the country reached a \u00adrecord low, dropping nearly 40 percent to just under 700,000 listings.\n\nDerrick Swaak, partner and managing broker at TTR Sotheby\u2019s International Realty in McLean, Va., and president of the Northern Virginia Association of Realtors, said the number of homes for sale at the end of December in his jurisdiction plummeted 50 to 60 percent from five years ago.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPart of the reason sellers are reluctant to list right now is not only because of the pandemic, but it\u2019s also where are they going to go and how are they going to find their next home?\u201d said Brito.\n\nMargeau Gilbert, a real estate agent with Exit Right Realty in Laurel, said the too-many-buyers-and-too-few-properties situation is not new.\n\nBut the historically low mortgage rates, spurred in part by a Federal Reserve move last spring to boost the economy through the purchase of mortgage-backed securities, has exacerbated demand. \u201cEven in the midst of covid-19, the market is on fire,\u201d said Gilbert.\n\nMeanwhile, home construction soared at the end of 2020. Housing starts, which measure the commencement of a residential project with the pouring of the foundation, overall increased 5.8 percent to 1.67 million units in December, according to the Census Bureau and NAHB. Housing starts for single-family houses, which represented 1.34 million of that figure, rose 12 percent, according to the report.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe housing starts in December is the strongest home building since 1.72 million units were started in September 2006,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\nThe industry has come a long way since the boom of the 2000s when developers created a housing bubble by constructing hundreds of thousands of houses on spec, expecting that eager buyers would snatch them up. The bubble burst in 2008, sparking the Great Recession. At the low point of the recession in April 2009, only 480,000 units were built compared with 2.27 million in January 2006 at the peak of home building, according to Zandi.\n\nThe rebound in the aftermath was sluggish, as developers faced tightened credit and a depleted workforce.\n\nAD\n\nDietz said that credit has eased somewhat for home builders, while tightening for nonresidential real estate development. \u201cThis was a positive surprise for the second half of 2020 for builders,\u201d although he warned that the cost of credit is increasing. Additionally, regulatory burdens remain, and lots have grown more scarce, which he said will be a looming challenge, especially in hot markets.\n\nAD\n\nStill, builders of single-family houses are facing head winds from labor shortages and rising lumber costs. As a result, the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index \u2014 a confidence meter for home builders \u2014 fell to 83 in January from 90 in December.\n\nThe NAHB Housing Opportunity Index notes that 16 of the least affordable markets in the nation are in California.\n\nWhat buyers want\n\nAs they emerged from the Great Recession, builders found they could only recoup their investment in the rising land costs by focusing on high-end single-family houses and luxury multiunit developments. The inability to build houses for moderate-income buyers exacerbated a shortage of affordable housing across the United States.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2020, all parts of the home-building industry expanded, including housing for entry-level buyers, said Dietz.\n\nAD\n\nTypically, new construction is mainly purchased by move-up buyers ages 35 to 55, said Dietz. In fact, five years ago, the first-time buyer share of the new home market was less than 20 percent. Today, he said, it is closer to 30 percent nationwide.\n\n\u201cEntry-level construction is easiest, in a relative sense, in more affordable markets like the Southeast, Texas and the Mountain States,\u201d Dietz said. \u201cThose happen to be the hottest housing markets in terms of home building for exactly that reason, it\u2019s easier to build, keeping housing from \u00adbecoming prohibitively unaffordable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNevertheless, Dietz said, building entry-level homes is still challenging \u201cbecause of issues related to fees, taxes and exclusionary zoning requirements that price out buyers from the market.\u201d\n\nZandi said the growing supply of entry-level new homes falls far short of the number of the homes needed for the population of young families and to put a dent in the undersupply of affordable housing that has developed across the country over the past decade. \u201cThe shortfall is close to an estimated 1.4 million homes,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nThe pandemic is driving changes in both ends of the market.\n\nMany high-end buyers, seeking more space inside and outside, have fled cities for suburbs and rural areas.

But that agreement, which tied the dollar\u2019s value to gold, caused a growing number of problems as the capitalist world expanded over the ensuing decades.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAugust 1971 brought a decisive change in the efforts to contain volatility when President Richard Nixon decided to end the dollar\u2019s tie to gold. After the gold standard ended, so did the system of fixed exchange rates in which different currencies were tied to the dollar and thus also to gold. Efforts to maintain a pegged exchange rate to the dollar, which once involved building reserves of gold, now tended to pit markets against central banks, with the latter attempting to prove their bona fides by raising interest rates\u2013until the rates grew unsustainable and the currency crashed. The advent of floating currencies added a valuable new adjustment mechanism to the world\u2019s financial order but created its own volatility.\n\nWe can see the series of informal regimes that have followed Bretton Woods by looking at the price of the S&P 500 index in gold terms\u2014in other words, the ratio of the S&P to the gold price.\n\n1971-81: The Oil Standard\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe world\u2019s financial system shifted \u00adeffectively to using oil as an anchor for the dollar once Nixon abandoned the peg to gold, given the central role petroleum played in global economic growth. Saudi Arabia and the other major petrostates agreed to conduct all their transactions in dollars, maintaining the currency\u2019s central role in the global economic order.\n\nThe U.S., freed from the \u201ccross of gold,\u201d embarked on expansionary fiscal policies, creating inflation and sending the price of gold higher. Oil producers responded by cutting supply and forcing up oil prices in dollars to ensure they\u2019d receive the same amount in gold terms as they had in the past. Ultimately the financial system remained tied to the value of one commodity\u2014the crucial difference was that oil, unlike gold, was vital to the cost of everyday life. The rising price of oil lifted consumer prices throughout the 1970s, eventually creating one of the most savage bear markets in stocks ever witnessed. Judged in real or gold terms, share prices collapsed, as did the price of bonds. This was volatility on a scale that hadn\u2019t been seen since before World War II.\n\n1981-98: The Volcker Standard\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe disruption driven by oil and widespread price inflation came to an end when the Federal Reserve, under Chairman Paul Volcker, convinced investors it was committed to curbing inflation\u2014even at the cost of a serious recession. Once this stability had been earned, fiat money could begin to regain the credibility it had enjoyed while it was backed by gold. By 1985 the dollar had grown so strong that a group of finance ministers and central bankers met at the Plaza Hotel in New York to agree on concerted action to weaken it.\n\nOnce investors were confident that inflation was under control, interest rates steadily declined. After peaking at more than 15% early in Volcker\u2019s tenure at the Fed, the 10-year Treasury yield\u2014the single most important financial benchmark for transactions around the world\u2014has dropped almost continuously since. Bond traders working today have no memory of the era when bond yields rose with any consistency. The fall in borrowing costs stimulated the economy and cushioned the stock market.\n\n\u201cAnimal spirits\u201d meant the market was still capable of overshooting, as it did leading up to the dramatic Black Monday crash in October 1987, when stock markets fell more than 20% in one day early in Alan Greenspan\u2019s term as Fed chairman.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1994, when the Greenspan Fed took the market by surprise by hiking interest rates to avert inflationary risks, the move strengthened the dollar and caused a sharp drop in bond prices (sometimes dubbed the \u201cgreat bond massacre\u201d). It also put intolerable strain on emerging countries that had been trying to contain their own inflation problems by pegging their currencies to the dollar. First, Mexico, in December 1994, then the emerging Tiger economies of Asia, in 1997, succumbed to a wave of devaluation and default crises.\n\n1998-2008: The Greenspan Put\n\nAs those emerging-market crises reverberated through the system, the \u201cPax Volckeriana\u201d broke down, along with the great equities bull market more than a decade into Greenspan\u2019s leadership. The 1998 implosion of Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund that had borrowed heavily from big Wall Street banks to place bets that soured quickly after Russia defaulted on its debt, was a critical moment. Credit markets froze almost completely.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRather than let banks fail, the Fed coordinated a bank-led bailout for LTCM (over the public criticism of Volcker) and cut interest rates three times. That rescued the equity market, which started to melt up into the dot-com bubble driven by rising internet stocks.\n\nThus began an era characterized by what became known as the \u201cGreenspan put\u201d\u2014total confidence that the Fed would always ease monetary policy to cushion falling asset prices. Concerned about \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d in the markets, the Greenspan put began raising rates in 1999 and early 2000. The dot-com bubble burst, and in 2001 the Fed started easing aggressively again. Bond yields continued their steady fall. The period soon became known as the Great Moderation\u2014credit grew ever cheaper, and the volatility of stock markets dwindled to record lows.\n\nStill, the rising gold price made clear that markets didn\u2019t trust the Greenspan Fed to protect the dollar\u2019s value in the same way they\u2019d trusted the Volcker Fed. They trusted the Fed to protect share prices but not to control inflation. Eventually this confidence that interest rates would keep falling led to the risk-taking that ended with the global financial crisis of 2008. As money became too cheap, lending standards weakened. When investors belatedly woke up to the fact that many of the loans would never be repaid, the financial system almost collapsed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2011-Present: The QE Standard\n\nThe disaster of 2008 created almost unprecedented volatility. Although U.S. authorities initially attempted to restore discipline by allowing the securities firm Lehman Brothers to fail, they quickly discovered the financial system was too interconnected to survive. The aftermath of Lehman\u2019s failure was so disastrous that policymakers and traders recognized that no other large institution could be allowed to fail\u2014creating a new level of \u201cmoral hazard\u201d in the system. And so the Greenspan put was extended under his successor, Ben Bernanke. The Fed bought bonds under the so-called quantitative easing, or QE, program to keep interest rates low. The price of gold skyrocketed as investors became convinced that inflation would follow in its wake.\n\nAround 2011, after years of desperate money-printing, investors still saw no sign that inflation was returning. With that came the idea that interest rates would remain stuck near zero forever. With the belief in \u201clower for longer\u201d firmly installed, the price of stocks in gold rose once more, peaking about a year before the Covid\u201119 pandemic and lockdowns created global recessions and scrambled all forecasts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCentral banks have responded by convincing markets that they remain determined to buy as many bonds as it takes to keep yields at minimal levels. In contrast to Volcker\u2019s determination to keep inflation under control, and Greenspan\u2019s refusal to let asset prices fall, we now have central banks\u2019 insistence on keeping borrowing costs low. This effectively forces investors to lend to the government at low rates, a policy known in market jargon as \u201cfinancial repression.\u201d For the time being, it\u2019s working. Equity market volatility remains elevated, but since spring 2020, bond market volatility has dropped to unprecedented lows.\n\nThe QE standard, or a refusal to let bond yields rise, has replaced the Bretton Woods gold standard as the anchor of the financial system. This can carry on as long as inflation doesn\u2019t return to the economy. At such a point as it does, we should all brace for a return to volatility. And the search will be on for yet another replacement.\n\nAuthers is a senior editor for markets coverage at Bloomberg News in New York.

Investors who followed their advice not to buy have missed out on enormous gains. Tesla has added more than $150 billion in market value in just the past week and, factoring in the potential increased share count from stock options it\u2019s now worth more than $1 trillion.\n\n\u201cThere is no graceful way to put this other than to say we got TSLA\u2019s stock completely wrong,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote last week. His peer, Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally, confessed he\u2019s been \u201con the considerably wrong side of TSLA for over a year now,\u201d and almost trebled his price target to $650. On Monday, Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Dan Levy doubled his target price to $800. The stock closed last week at $880.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo Tesla supporters these mea culpas will be seen as confirmation that auto sector analysts have never properly understood the company. Tesla\u2019s ambitions extend well beyond building cars to encompass things like solar power and energy storage. Yet the analysts covering the stock are mostly car industry experts.\n\nMusk has encouraged his followers to ignore what Wall Street says and chastised these financial interlocutors for asking \u201cboring boneheaded\u201d questions on earnings calls.\n\n\u201cI do think that a lot of retail investors actually have deeper and more accurate insights than many of the big institutional investors and certainly better insight than many of the analysts,\u201d Musk said last year. Who needs expensive advice from a big-name investment bank when there\u2019s Reddit?\n\nAD\n\nTesla\u2019s prospects have improved lately: Its manufacturing struggles have abated, the balance sheet is more secure and it has chalked up several quarters of profitability. Joe Biden\u2019s election should mean U.S. policy becomes more favorable toward electric vehicles. However, none of this justifies valuing Musk\u2019s company at an eye-watering 27 times its expected revenues for 2020 (for context: one of Tesla\u2019s biggest competitors, Volkswagen AG, trades on 0.3 times sales).\n\nAD\n\nSpak\u2019s awkward explanation for abandoning his bearish stance spoke volumes: He said his biggest miss was underestimating Tesla\u2019s ability to \u201ctake advantage of its stock price to raise capital inexpensively and fund capacity outlays and growth.\u201d\n\nIn other words, he failed to anticipate Tesla\u2019s stock would surge to such lofty heights and thus enable it to print money without diluting existing investors too much \u2014 Tesla raised about $12 billion from stock sales in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nYou know Alice has reached Wonderland when one of the chief arguments for buying a stock is the cash it can generate from issuing even more stock. To be clear, this certainly is a big advantage compared to VW and other traditional automakers that have to fund investments by selling cars. Tesla isn\u2019t unique though in this regard: Chinese automaker NIO Inc. and a slew of new entrants backed by special purpose acquisition companies have exploited investor fervor to raise money cheaply too.\n\nAD\n\nThe more bullish Tesla analysts typically ascribe a lot of value to activities such as autonomous ride-hailing, third-party power train sales, energy and insurance, some of which are small or don\u2019t exist yet. \u201cThink of Tesla as an ESG or climate-change innovation ETF,\u201d says Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas who cryptically calls Tesla the \u201cChosen One.\u201d\n\nFortunately, others remain dogged in their unfashionable and more circumspect views. \u201cAt the end of the day, investments are worth the discounted value of their future cash flow,\u201d JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Ryan Brinkman told Bloomberg News\u2019s Esha Dey recently. Brinkman\u2019s $105 price target is more than 85% below the current level.\n\nAD\n\nBarclays analyst Brian Johnson\u2019s $230 price target reflects execution risks and the competition Tesla will encounter from other automakers. He\u2019s the first to admit that his warning that Tesla\u2019s rise is reminiscent of the dotcom bubble makes him sound like a boring \u201cOK, boomer,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s wrong.\n\nAD\n\nIn truth, portfolio managers don\u2019t always pay a lot of attention to the target price analysts put on a stock. The top-rated analysts aren\u2019t always the best stock pickers: It\u2019s the quality and originality of their analysis that matters.\n\nSo I hope Brinkman and Johnson resist external pressure to get with the \u201cnew paradigm\u201d because the market is healthier when there\u2019s a plurality of views. If the sell side capitulates and provides an after-the-fact justification for Tesla\u2019s inexplicable surge, then Tesla risks becoming totally unmoored. And then retail investors who bested the analysts last year really will risk getting hurt.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nChris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies.

What\u2019s the power struggle?\n\nThe 2015-2016 presidential election was so chaotic that the eventual winner, Jovenel Moise, wasn\u2019t sworn into office until Feb. 7, 2017 -- 15 months after the initial first-round vote. As a result, Moise says his five-year term runs until Feb. 7, 2022. A coalition of opposition groups say his term began when his predecessor, Michel Martelly, stepped down on Feb. 7, 2016, and therefore ended on Feb. 7, 2021. The dispute has led to widespread protests and accusations that Moise is using heavy-handed tactics to cling to power. The standoff took a dramatic turn in early February when the government announced that almost two dozen people had been arrested for plotting a coup.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2. How is Moise staying in power?\n\nMoise has governed by decree since January 2020, when parliamentary terms expired without scheduled elections being held. The opposition says Moise is illegally amassing power and making laws in violation of the constitution. \u201cI am not a dictator,\u201d Moise told Haitians on Feb. 7. Among his most controversial initiatives is the creation of an intelligence service that reports directly to him. He also broadened the definition of \u201cterrorism\u201d to include fires and roadblocks -- common forms of protest. Non-governmental groups say Moise and his cronies have dragged their feet on corruption investigations and have colluded with violent gangs, sometimes to squelch dissent.\n\n3. What does Moise say?\n\nAD\n\nThat Haiti has been ungovernable for decades and that side-stepping parliament was necessary to pave the way for a planned constitutional referendum on April 25 and fresh legislative and presidential elections in September.\n\nAD\n\n4. What changes does he want to the constitution?\n\nMoise says the 1987 constitution gives the legislative branch too much power and is one of the root causes of Haiti\u2019s political instability. (Since a popular uprising ended the 15-year rule of Jean-Claude \u201cBaby Doc\u201d Duvalier in 1986, the nation has churned through 20 presidential administrations.) The new constitution would eliminate the position of prime minister and create the office of the vice president. It would also collapse the Senate and Chamber of Deputies into a single, unicameral body. The new constitution would also give Haiti\u2019s vast diaspora more political rights. Crucially, the new constitution sets presidential term limits at two five-year terms. Under the current document, presidents can only serve non-consecutive terms. Despite opposition fears, Moise has said he would not use the constitutional overhaul as justification to seek re-election.\n\nAD\n\n5. How close did Haiti get to a coup?\n\nAD\n\nOn Feb. 7 -- the day that the opposition claims Moise\u2019s term ended -- the government announced the arrest of 23 people for allegedly plotting to topple the administration and assassinate Moise. Among the purported ringleaders was a judge. The opposition says Moise was using the alleged plot as an excuse to round up prominent critics, and that he violated the constitution by arresting public officials who have immunity. Even so, in the wake of the arrests, the opposition declared Joseph Mecene Jean-Louis, a Supreme Court judge, the interim president. So far that move has been symbolic, as no international organizations or governments have recognized his authority.\n\n6. How has the U.S. responded?\n\nAD\n\nFor months, the U.S. State Department, along with the Organization of American States, has urged Moise to hold legislative elections and restore the balance of power. But they also agree with his central contention that the clock on his presidential term started running in 2017, so a new president shouldn\u2019t take office until February 2022. The Donald Trump administration maintained cordial relations with Moise, one of the few Caribbean backers of the U.S. campaign against the Venezuelan government. That dynamic might change under the Biden administration, which has signaled it will put a greater emphasis on fighting institutional corruption that it blames for exacerbating poverty and eroding democracy in the region. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. House has urged the State Department to condemn Moise and says the Haitian leader \u201chas lost all credibility.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n7. Where is the dispute headed?\n\nThe opposition says it\u2019s not backing down and will continue the street protests that have led to bloody clashes with police and paralyzed large swaths of the country. Moise says he\u2019s focused on overhauling the country\u2019s power grid, drafting a new constitution and holding legislative and presidential elections. Meanwhile, the international community will be keeping an eye on surging gang and political violence that at least one observer says is making Haiti \u201ca Somalia in the Americas.\u201d In addition, there will also be growing pressure to hold the Moise administration to account for corruption and its authoritarian impulses.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9762293100357056}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The 2015 - 2016 presidential election was so chaotic that the eventual winner , Jovenel Moise , was n\u2019t sworn into office until Feb. 7 , 2017 -- 15 months after the initial first - round vote.

What\u2019s this dispute about?\n\nOn May 5, China surprised India by deploying troops in three main locations, two of them in Ladakh, a remote part of northernmost India abutting Tibet (an autonomous region of China) and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The 3,488 kilometer (2,167 miles) border is ill-defined and the reason for the maneuver was unclear, but earlier actions by India regarding the territories of Ladakh, whose people are culturally close to Tibet, and Kashmir had drawn angry responses from its neighbors. China has accused India of seeking \u201cto undermine its territorial sovereignty.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n2. How bad did it get?\n\nThe confrontation was centered on the Galwan River area and Pangong Tso, a glacial lake at 14,000 feet (4,300 meters) in the Tibetan plateau. After weeks of skirmishes, 20 Indian soldiers died in mid-June a violent clash with Chinese troops. A Chinese military spokesperson said there were casualties on both sides without elaborating. Tensions flared again on Aug. 31 after India moved troops to the hilltops on its side of the border at Pangong Tso lake to stop a push by Chinese forces. In September, the two sides renewed pledges to de-escalate tensions after their defense and foreign ministers met for the first time since the standoff began. That was followed by an agreement to stop sending troops to the front line and, in February, confirmation of a pullback from Pangong lake. India\u2019s defense minister Rajnath Singh said another round of talks between military commanders would be held to discuss withdrawing soldiers from other disputed areas along the frontier.\n\n3. How old is the India-China border conflict?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt dates back to the 1950s. Skirmishes were reported after India granted the Dalai Lama asylum following an uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet in 1959. War broke out three years later after China objected to India establishing outposts along the effective boundary, established by the British in 1914, between the Tibetan region and Northeast India. The current \u201cLine of Actual Control\u201d that forms the ambiguous border partially adheres to the British-drawn boundaries. Clashes were also reported in 1967 and again in 1987 in what\u2019s sometimes referred to as the loudspeaker war -- no bullets were fired and soldiers simply kept shouting at each other via loudspeakers. Relations improved as the two governments signed five treaties between 1993 and 2013 and -- with economic growth racing ahead in both countries -- China became India\u2019s largest trading partner. The border remained mostly calm through 2017, when troops faced off for several months at Doklam, a plateau near the Indian border that is claimed by both China and Bhutan. The clashes are mostly seasonal, given the harsh winter conditions.\n\n4. What\u2019s different now?\n\nThe context. The coronavirus outbreak has infected more than 10.8 million people and severely damaged the economy over the past year. India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been shifting his country closer to the U.S. as relations with China have worsened. Since 2017, India has signed crucial communications and arms agreements with the U.S. and blocked dozens of Chinese apps on national security grounds. India has also prevented Chinese companies from taking over local businesses and stepped up road construction in border areas. China has been building border infrastructure for decades, including -- to India\u2019s chagrin -- through disputed areas that link China to Pakistan. Meanwhile, China is getting more assertive. It pressed ahead in the face of international condemnation with a new security law in Hong Kong, while also getting involved in more military run-ins in the South China Sea and warning Taiwan against any moves toward independence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n5. Will tensions escalate?\n\nMost observers had been speculating that war was unlikely since neither side wanted to escalate matters. One outcome may be closer alignment between India and the U.S. The U.S. has been broadening trade and strategic ties with countries in the Indo-Pacific region. The long-moribund Quad -- a security framework with the U.S., Japan and Australia -- has been revived and in November held naval exercises in the Indian Ocean. Still, there\u2019s always a chance border scuffles will resume elsewhere. India last year opened a bridge to enable faster movement of troops and artillery in the region of the 2017 border clashes.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.7719506025314331}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "On May 5 , China surprised India by deploying troops in three main locations , two of them in Ladakh , a remote part of northernmost India abutting Tibet ( an autonomous region of China ) and Pakistan - occupied Kashmir.

Facing threats by Trump\u2019s legal team to try to call hundreds of witnesses, they settled for a sworn statement from Beutler, who said Trump had told House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) during the Capitol riot, \u201cWell, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe decision was immediately derided by many as caving to pressure and trying to wrap things up as soon as possible \u2014 despite the trial to date raising all kinds of questions about what Trump did and when. We won\u2019t find out at this trial, it seems.\n\nSo what did we miss out on? Before the deal was cut, I made a list of a bunch of witnesses who could shed real light on the trial \u2014 but now won\u2019t.\n\n1. Beutler\n\nJust when it appeared the trial was winding down, Beutler inserted herself. Not only did she confirm the initial report of the Trump-McCarthy call, but she put out a news release indicating she was upset that her colleagues hadn\u2019t come forward with such details.\n\nAD\n\nVan der Veen downplayed the importance of the call by claiming that what happened after the attempted insurrection started doesn\u2019t speak to incitement. But Democrats have argued Trump\u2019s inaction and even approval of the scenes as they unfolded speaks to the idea that this is an outcome he desired or at least was okay with.\n\nAD\n\nBeutler and possibly even McCarthy testifying would seem important to that argument. But Beutler wa clearly the more motivated witness and would be easier to depose since she\u2019s not a member of leadership.\n\n2. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.)\n\nThe other Trump call at issue was the one with Tuberville around the time of Trump\u2019s tweet attacking then-Vice President Mike Pence. Tuberville has said and reiterated that he informed Trump that Pence had been evacuated.\n\nAD\n\nGiven that, there were questions about whether Tuberville might have informed Trump about this just before Trump\u2019s 2:24 p.m. tweet, which would make Trump\u2019s tweet look really bad. But Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) has now turned over call records indicating Trump actually called him shortly after the tweet, at 2:26 p.m., at which point Lee handed the phone to Tuberville.\n\nAD\n\nBut Tuberville\u2019s testimony would still be relevant. It gets at Democrats\u2019 argument that Trump was focused on overturning the election, rather than the danger faced by lawmakers, even as the Capitol was under siege.\n\nAnd nailing down the timeline and specifically what Trump said is entirely relevant. Having Tuberville testify would seem to help satisfy the need to investigate that question, which even Trump\u2019s lawyers claimed Friday they didn\u2019t have clarity on. It would also help answer the same question involved in the Trump-McCarthy call: Whether Trump was approving of or at least indifferent to the danger.\n\n3. The Capitol rioters who cited Trump\n\nMany who were arrested in connection with the Capitol siege have cited perceived invitations from Trump as part of their defense, and that number grew on the eve or the trial this week. One lawyer for the accused said Trump was \u201csomewhat of a de facto unindicted co-conspirator in this case.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI\u2019ve written about how this might be legal maneuvering as much as anything \u2014 attempting to shift blame to Trump for their own actions. But these are also Trump supporters. And just because there are competing motivations doesn\u2019t render their claims invalid. One of them, the so-called QAnon Shaman, Jacob Chansley, has offered to testify. That might not be a great idea for Democrats, given this was the guy wearing the horns, but that still leaves others who could shed arguably the most direct light on the incitement question.\n\nVan der Veen suggested Saturday that among his more than 100 depositions might be those people who stormed the Capitol. Again, this seems like a valid pursuit, time permitting.\n\n4. The Trump aides involved in planning the rally\n\nIn the aftermath of the Capitol siege, the Trump campaign sought to distance itself not just from what happened there, but also from the rally that preceded it on the Ellipse near the White House. It said the campaign \u201cdid not organize, operate or finance the event\u201d and that no aides were involved in it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince then, though, we\u2019ve learned about several connections between the rally and the Trump campaign and White House, beyond just Trump\u2019s speech:\n\nMegan Powers, one of two operations advisers for the event, had been the Trump campaign\u2019s director of operations, according to AP\n\nCaroline Wren, who was listed as a \u201cVIP Advisor\u201d on a permit for the event, had served as a consultant for the joint fundraising effort between the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. ProPublica later reported that a rally organizer said Wren and others had pushed her aside as Trump\u2019s involvement materialized\n\nMaggie Mulvaney, a \u201cVIP Lead\u201d on the permit, had served as director of finance operations for the Trump campaign.\n\nKatrina Pierson was a liaison between the rally organizers and the White House, according to multiple reports\n\nAP reported that some of these officials locked down or deactivated their social media accounts and deleted tweets in the aftermath of the siege. Some Trump allies have sought to argue that the rally was distinct from the storming of the Capitol, which might be a valid defense, but the distancing from the Trump operation from the latter would seem to be worth exploring.\n\n5. Brad Raffensperger\n\nSome congressional Republicans on Jan. 4 criticized President Trump for asking Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d votes. (JM Rieger/The Washington Post)\n\nRepublicans have tried to argue that Trump\u2019s impeachment is only about his speech on Jan. 6. But the impeachment article filed against him also notes his conduct in trying to overturn the election results well before that date. Trump for many weeks promoted conspiracy theories and false claims that fed an overwhelming but baseless belief among his supporters that the election was stolen.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne person is explicitly mentioned in the article: Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R). Citing a report from The Washington Post\u2019s Amy Gardner that Trump pressured Raffensperger to overturn Georgia\u2019s narrow win for President Biden in the days before the Capitol siege, the impeachment article says:\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021, followed his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct the certification of the results of the 2020 Presidential election. Those prior efforts included a phone call on January 2, 2021, during which President Trump urged the secretary of state of Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to overturn the Georgia Presidential election results and threatened Secretary Raffensperger if he failed to do so.\n\nRaffensperger has been very public in his comments about the baselessness of Trump\u2019s claims. And if there\u2019s one person who could attest to his long-running effort to feed into the conspiracy theories that motivated those who stormed the Capitol, it\u2019s probably Raffensperger.\n\nThat might not answer the incitement question, but he is directly cited in the impeachment article, and he has been willing to speak his mind, despite his shared party affiliation with and past support for Trump \u2014 along with the fact that he has probably torpedoed his political career for his trouble.\n\n6. Dustin Stockton\n\nThis name might not be familiar to many people, but when it comes to the how the Jan. 6 rally became the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol, it\u2019s entirely relevant.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStockton is an ally of pardoned former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon and a former Breitbart News employee. He told the New York Times last week that the rally at the Ellipse had been meant to stay there until the counting of the electoral college votes was completed, but that he was surprised to learn on Jan. 6 that the rally then included a march to the Capitol.\n\nHow did that happen? Pretty much anybody who could speak to the evolution of the Ellipse rally into the siege would be important.\n\n7. Trump\n\nYes, Democrats have requested this. And no, he won\u2019t show up. But that doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t be vital. The question here, after all, is whether Trump incited his supporters. Hearing his argument about why that isn\u2019t the case would be helpful.\n\nAD\n\nAnother pertinent question: What did he know and when about the Capitol riot as it was progressing? Even as news reports showed the ugly scenes, Trump doubled down on his criticisms of Vice President Mike Pence for not unilaterally trying to overturn the results of the election. His tweet on Pence, in fact, came just after reports indicated Pence had been escorted off the Senate floor for his safety. Trump also released a video hours later telling his supporters to be peaceful and to leave, but also expressing his \u201clove\u201d for them.\n\nAD\n\nThe charge is incitement, but Trump\u2019s posture toward the scenes as they were taking place is relevant to understanding if this was an outcome he desired.\n\n8. Mark Meadows\n\nTo the above question, perhaps nobody could speak to it as well as the White House chief of staff. He was with Trump as it was unfolding, as video showed. He was also in regular touch with military leaders, according to Kash Patel, the chief of staff to then-Defense Secretary Christopher Miller.\n\nMeadows has also defended Trump, including Sunday, by saying Trump offered military help but that it was rejected. \u201cSome of those decisions weren\u2019t made appropriately, in my opinion, and those decisions did not come from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,\u201d Meadows told Fox News. \u201cIt came from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201d\n\n9. Constitutionality witnesses\n\nBy all accounts, the Trump defense will rest upon the constitutionality of the proceedings. As mentioned above, 45 GOP senators voted that the proceedings themselves violated the Constitution, and Republicans have repeatedly signified that they would rather debate process issues than Trump\u2019s actual conduct.\n\nBut Democrats might not want to concede the point. The fact is that even many conservative legal experts have argued that an impeachment trial of a former president is constitutional. Among them: Steven Calabresi, the co-founder of the Federalist Society, and Charles Fried, a solicitor general under President Ronald Reagan.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/02-13-2021/t_4edd07335df04457aa32b24f50a728ed_name_thumb.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9487609267234802}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Facing threats by Trump \u2019s legal team to try to call hundreds of witnesses , they settled for a sworn statement from Beutler , who said Trump had told House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R - Calif. ) during the Capitol riot , \u201c Well , Kevin , I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are \u201d.

But being impeached is not the same as being convicted and kicked out of office or barred from ever holding it again.\n\nThat\u2019s up to the Senate, which begins its trial of Trump on Tuesday. It\u2019s the first time a former president has been the subject of such a trial.\n\n[Live updates: Day one of Trump's impeachment trial ]\n\nHere\u2019s how we got here, what\u2019s happening and what will happen next.\n\nWhat\u2019s the schedule for the impeachment trial?\n\nThe trial officially begins Tuesday at 1 p.m. Eastern time, when the senators will be sworn in for the trial. That day, they will debate on the constitutionality of the trial, something Republicans and Trump\u2019s legal team have questioned based on Trump\u2019s status as a former president.\n\nOn the subsequent days, both sides will get 16 hours each to lay out their arguments. That\u2019s likely to take the trial to Sunday or Monday, depending on how long the Senate stays in session each day and whether it takes any days off over the weekend.\n\nAfter that, the Senate will debate and then vote on whether to bring witnesses into the trial. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and other impeachment managers have said they want to bring in witnesses, while both Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have expressed a preference for a shorter trial. A simple majority vote against witnesses would put Trump on track for a conviction or acquittal next week.\n\nWhy was Trump impeached again?\n\nImpeaching Trump in his final days in office was not on Congress\u2019s to-do list; then Jan. 6 happened. The attempt by Trump supporters to stop Congress from counting the electoral college votes that would make Joe Biden president ultimately failed. But Democrats, and even some Republicans, accused Trump of inciting the attempted insurrection, and on Jan. 13, he was impeached by the House on a single charge to that effect.\n\n[What Trump said before his supporters stormed the Capitol, annotated]\n\nThe article the House sent over is short but makes three main points \u2014 mainly, that Trump committed \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d because:\n\n1. He falsely claimed he won the election: \u201cShortly before the Joint Session commenced, President Trump addressed a crowd of his political supporters nearby. There, he reiterated false claims that \u2018we won this election, and we won it by a landslide.\u2019 \u201d\n\n2. He encouraged the riot: \u201cHe willfully made statements that encouraged \u2014 and foreseeably resulted in \u2014 imminent lawless action at the Capitol. Incited by President Trump, a mob unlawfully breached the Capitol, injured law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of Congress and the Vice President, interfered with the Joint Session\u2019s solemn constitutional duty to certify the election results, and engaged in violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts.\u201d\n\n3. He\u2019d been putting actions to his words to try to overturn his loss: The article mentions a call Trump held with Georgia\u2019s secretary of state urging him to \u201cfind\u201d just enough votes to overturn Biden\u2019s win there.\n\nThe Constitution says the president can be impeached in the House, tried by the Senate, then removed from office (or in this case barred from ever holding federal office again) if convicted of \u201cTreason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats uniformly thought Trump\u2019s words before the attack on the Capitol constituted high crimes or misdemeanors \u2014 all 222 of them voted in favor of impeachment. And in a notable change from Trump\u2019s first impeachment, 10 House Republicans voted to impeach, led by Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the No. 3 House Republican.\n\n\u201cThe president of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,\u201d Cheney said in a statement, adding, \u201cThere has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.\u201d\n\nTrump is already out of office. What are the consequences of holding a trial now?\n\nTrump will go down in history as being the first U.S. president to be impeached twice. But because his term ended Jan. 20, when President Biden was sworn in, it\u2019s too late to remove him from office.\n\nTrump potentially being barred from running for federal office again is the big one. That would require conviction by two-thirds of the Senate, then a simple majority vote on a separate measure to bar him from running again. Trump could, of course, still be a force in politics even if he can\u2019t run by doing things like fundraising, making appearances with candidates or appearing in conservative media.\n\nPresidents traditionally get security briefings after their time in office, though not at the frequency current presidents do. They also keep access to classified information. But limiting Trump\u2019s access to security briefings is actually up to the Biden administration \u2014 and it\u2019s something Biden\u2019s chief of staff says they\u2019re considering.\n\n\u201cWe will certainly look for a recommendation from the intelligence professionals in the Biden administration, once they\u2019re in place,\u201d White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, \u201cand we will act on that recommendation.\u201d\n\nAs for the other post-presidential benefits, it\u2019s likely that Trump will get to keep them even if he\u2019s convicted. The legislation that first put the presidential pension and other benefits in place essentially says that presidents who leave office as a result of a new president being elected get the benefits. It says former presidents \u201cwhose service in such office shall have terminated other than by removal pursuant to section 4 of article II of the Constitution of the United States of America\u201d are eligible \u2014 and since Trump is already out of office, having left when Biden was inaugurated, those benefits are already in place.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nSchumer and McConnell on Monday were close to announcing an agreement on the trial\u2019s format; because this is a Senate trial and not a court of law, the Senate gets to set its own trial rules.\n\nThe agreement calls for up to four hours of debate on Tuesday over the constitutionality of the trial, essentially a repeat of the vote Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) forced on Jan 26. 45 Republican senators voted against holding the trial at that point.\n\nThen on Wednesday afternoon, the serious legal arguments are set to begin. The Democratic house impeachment managers will present their case against the president first, then the former president\u2019s lawyers will present their defense.\n\nThe organizing resolution Schumer and McConnell negotiated then allows the impeachment managers to call for a vote on whether to bring in witnesses, if they chose. While the impeachment managers have said they want to bring in witnesses, Democratic leaders are wary of prolonging the trial. It would take a simple majority of senators to include witnesses in the trial.\n\n[Who are the impeachment managers? ]\n\nRaskin and the other impeachment managers sent Trump a letter the week before the trial was to start asking him to provide testimony either before or during the trial. Trump\u2019s team quickly rejected the request, calling it a \u201cpublic relations stunt\u201d and claiming that the trial itself is unconstitutional, an argument they plan to focus on when presenting their defense.\n\n\u201cIf you decline this invitation, we reserve any and all rights, including the right to establish at trial that your refusal to testify supports a strong adverse inference regarding your actions (and inaction) on January 6, 2021,\u201d Raskin wrote.\n\nOne key change from the last trial \u2014 at the request of Trump\u2019s legal team, the Senate will recess as an impeachment court from 5 p.m. Friday through Sunday morning, likely setting up Sunday afternoon arguments.\n\nTrump\u2019s first trial began Jan. 16, 2020, and he was acquitted three weeks later on Feb. 5. It\u2019s unclear how long Trump\u2019s second trial will last, especially if Democrats are able to call witnesses this time.\n\nWho will represent Trump?\n\nThe lawyers who made up Trump\u2019s defense team in his first impeachment either declined to represent him this time or were White House attorneys no longer in Trump\u2019s employ now that he\u2019s out of office.\n\nThat means Trump had to hire a new team of private lawyers \u2014 and it hasn\u2019t gone smoothly.\n\nThe former president parted ways with a team led by Butch Bowers, a South Carolina lawyer, on Jan. 31, due to differences over legal strategy. Trump hired two new lawyers, Bruce Castor and David Schoen, shortly thereafter.\n\nCastor is the former district attorney for Montgomery County, Pa. He also happens to be the cousin of Steve Castor, a lawyer for House Republicans who featured prominently in their defense of Trump\u2019s first impeachment. In 2005, Bruce Castor declined to charge comedian Bill Cosby after a Temple University employee accused him of sexual misconduct \u2014 and later said he\u2019d made a secret deal with Cosby not to charge him. The Fix\u2019s Aaron Blake looks at that decision more in-depth here.\n\nSchoen, a defense lawyer based in Atlanta, has ties to controversial defendants as well: former Trump adviser Roger Stone and accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Schoen has said he thinks his link to Stone got him a recommendation for the job.\n\nSchoen told The Washington Post\u2019s Katie Shepherd that the new team will not focus on Trump\u2019s claims of election fraud, but instead on an argument that the trial itself is unconstitutional because Trump is out of office.\n\n\u201cI am not a person who will put forward a theory of election fraud,\u201d Schoen said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what this impeachment trial is about.\u201d\n\nWill there actually be enough votes in the Senate to convict Trump?\n\nConvicting Trump requires support of two-thirds of the Senate, more than the Democratic majority. Seventeen Senate Republicans would have to vote to convict.\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) forced a procedural vote on whether it was even constitutional to hold a trial of a former president. All but five of the Senate\u2019s 50 Republicans voted to say it wasn\u2019t, a number that seems to indicate that there\u2019s little chance of Trump ultimately being convicted.\n\n\u201cI think there will be enough support on it to show there\u2019s no chance they can impeach the president,\u201d Paul told reporters before the vote. \u201cIf 34 people support my resolution that this is an unconstitutional proceeding, it shows they don\u2019t have the votes and we\u2019re basically wasting our time.\u201d\n\nThe Post\u2019s Ashlyn Still and JM Rieger have a running tracker of where both Democrats and Republicans stand. So far, about a dozen Republican senators have expressed openness to the impeachment trial, though which way they will vote remains uncertain.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had previously blamed Trump for the events of Jan. 6, without explicitly saying how he\u2019d vote in a trial.\n\n\u201cThe mob was fed lies,\u201d McConnell said in the Senate\u2019s first session back after certifying Biden\u2019s win. \u201cThey were provoked by the president and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like. But we pressed on, we stood together and said an angry mob would not get veto power over the rule of law in our nation.\u201d\n\nA conviction is necessary to hold the second, arguably more consequential vote to bar Trump from ever holding federal office again. That action only takes a majority vote.\n\nAnswering your questions on impeachment\n\nDoes Trump have to appear in person at the Senate trial?\n\nNot only does he not have to, it\u2019s unlikely he will. Remember, Trump just went through an impeachment trial a year ago, and he was only a couple of miles away in the White House at the time. He didn\u2019t make an appearance then, despite at one point saying he would \u201cstrongly consider\u201d testifying either in writing or in person. Now he lives in Florida, and there\u2019s no indication that he\u2019s coming back to Washington for the trial.\n\nWhat is the origin of Trump\u2019s claim of election fraud? Did he ever present any tangible evidence in any court filing?\n\nTrump had been hinting that he might not accept election results as far back as his 2016 run \u2014 it\u2019s a consistent part of his playbook. But when it comes to specific allegations about the 2020 results, Trump first claimed a win (without results having come in) in a tweet at 12:45 a.m. Nov. 4. A few minutes later, he alleged, \u201cWe are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it.\u201d\n\nThat seems to be the first time after election night that Trump alluded to stopping the process in some way. Democrats have indicated that they plan to use Trump\u2019s tweets against him when they present their case to the Senate.\n\nTrump and his lawyers lost more than 50 lawsuits contesting results, which The Post goes more in depth on here. The Justice Department took the unusual step of using department resources to investigate election fraud claims, but then-Attorney General William P. Barr said Dec. 1 that \u201cto date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\u201d In other words, Trump was unable to present any real evidence of voter fraud.\n\nCould the Senate hold a secret ballot so senators don\u2019t feel political blowback for their votes?\n\nThe Senate sets its own rules for the trial, and since Democrats hold a slim majority (including Vice President Harris\u2019s tiebreaking vote) they could, in theory, make the vote private. But, as The Post\u2019s Philip Bump writes, the Constitution makes it pretty easy for Republicans to object \u2014 if just 20 of the 50 Republicans in the Senate voted for a public vote, they\u2019d get it, making a private vote very unlikely.\n\nWhat other questions do you have?\n\nSubmit them here, and we\u2019ll update this post with answers.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W4MRWQC3FQI6XKCJN6KCHJ277U.jpg&w=1200"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9891840815544128}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "But being impeached is not the same as being convicted and kicked out of office or barred from ever holding it again. \n\n That \u2019s up to the Senate , which begins its trial of Trump on Tuesday."}, "category": "Business"}, {"id": "c536ade7-415e-46b4-a935-894a4c989772", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "9 witnesses who could have offered vital testimony at Trump\u2019s impeachment trial", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/02/08/7-witnesses-who-should-testify-trumps-impeachment-trial/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_politics", "description": "There is plenty we still don't know and could learn from testimony. And we might now get the chance.", "published": "Sat, 13 Feb 2021 13:13:03 EST", "body": "Then, the Democrats cut a deal in which Beutler\u2019s statement would merely be entered into the record. Facing threats by Trump\u2019s legal team to try to call hundreds of witnesses, they settled for a sworn statement from Beutler, who said Trump had told House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) during the Capitol riot, \u201cWell, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe decision was immediately derided by many as caving to pressure and trying to wrap things up as soon as possible \u2014 despite the trial to date raising all kinds of questions about what Trump did and when. We won\u2019t find out at this trial, it seems.\n\nSo what did we miss out on? Before the deal was cut, I made a list of a bunch of witnesses who could shed real light on the trial \u2014 but now won\u2019t.\n\n1. Beutler\n\nJust when it appeared the trial was winding down, Beutler inserted herself. Not only did she confirm the initial report of the Trump-McCarthy call, but she put out a news release indicating she was upset that her colleagues hadn\u2019t come forward with such details.\n\nAD\n\nVan der Veen downplayed the importance of the call by claiming that what happened after the attempted insurrection started doesn\u2019t speak to incitement. But Democrats have argued Trump\u2019s inaction and even approval of the scenes as they unfolded speaks to the idea that this is an outcome he desired or at least was okay with.\n\nAD\n\nBeutler and possibly even McCarthy testifying would seem important to that argument. But Beutler wa clearly the more motivated witness and would be easier to depose since she\u2019s not a member of leadership.\n\n2. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.)\n\nThe other Trump call at issue was the one with Tuberville around the time of Trump\u2019s tweet attacking then-Vice President Mike Pence. Tuberville has said and reiterated that he informed Trump that Pence had been evacuated.\n\nAD\n\nGiven that, there were questions about whether Tuberville might have informed Trump about this just before Trump\u2019s 2:24 p.m. tweet, which would make Trump\u2019s tweet look really bad. But Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) has now turned over call records indicating Trump actually called him shortly after the tweet, at 2:26 p.m., at which point Lee handed the phone to Tuberville.\n\nAD\n\nBut Tuberville\u2019s testimony would still be relevant. It gets at Democrats\u2019 argument that Trump was focused on overturning the election, rather than the danger faced by lawmakers, even as the Capitol was under siege.\n\nAnd nailing down the timeline and specifically what Trump said is entirely relevant. Having Tuberville testify would seem to help satisfy the need to investigate that question, which even Trump\u2019s lawyers claimed Friday they didn\u2019t have clarity on. It would also help answer the same question involved in the Trump-McCarthy call: Whether Trump was approving of or at least indifferent to the danger.\n\n3. The Capitol rioters who cited Trump\n\nMany who were arrested in connection with the Capitol siege have cited perceived invitations from Trump as part of their defense, and that number grew on the eve or the trial this week. One lawyer for the accused said Trump was \u201csomewhat of a de facto unindicted co-conspirator in this case.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI\u2019ve written about how this might be legal maneuvering as much as anything \u2014 attempting to shift blame to Trump for their own actions. But these are also Trump supporters. And just because there are competing motivations doesn\u2019t render their claims invalid. One of them, the so-called QAnon Shaman, Jacob Chansley, has offered to testify. That might not be a great idea for Democrats, given this was the guy wearing the horns, but that still leaves others who could shed arguably the most direct light on the incitement question.\n\nVan der Veen suggested Saturday that among his more than 100 depositions might be those people who stormed the Capitol. Again, this seems like a valid pursuit, time permitting.\n\n4. The Trump aides involved in planning the rally\n\nIn the aftermath of the Capitol siege, the Trump campaign sought to distance itself not just from what happened there, but also from the rally that preceded it on the Ellipse near the White House. It said the campaign \u201cdid not organize, operate or finance the event\u201d and that no aides were involved in it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince then, though, we\u2019ve learned about several connections between the rally and the Trump campaign and White House, beyond just Trump\u2019s speech:\n\nMegan Powers, one of two operations advisers for the event, had been the Trump campaign\u2019s director of operations, according to AP\n\nCaroline Wren, who was listed as a \u201cVIP Advisor\u201d on a permit for the event, had served as a consultant for the joint fundraising effort between the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. ProPublica later reported that a rally organizer said Wren and others had pushed her aside as Trump\u2019s involvement materialized\n\nMaggie Mulvaney, a \u201cVIP Lead\u201d on the permit, had served as director of finance operations for the Trump campaign.\n\nKatrina Pierson was a liaison between the rally organizers and the White House, according to multiple reports\n\nAP reported that some of these officials locked down or deactivated their social media accounts and deleted tweets in the aftermath of the siege. Some Trump allies have sought to argue that the rally was distinct from the storming of the Capitol, which might be a valid defense, but the distancing from the Trump operation from the latter would seem to be worth exploring.\n\n5. Brad Raffensperger\n\nSome congressional Republicans on Jan. 4 criticized President Trump for asking Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d votes. (JM Rieger/The Washington Post)\n\nRepublicans have tried to argue that Trump\u2019s impeachment is only about his speech on Jan. 6. But the impeachment article filed against him also notes his conduct in trying to overturn the election results well before that date. Trump for many weeks promoted conspiracy theories and false claims that fed an overwhelming but baseless belief among his supporters that the election was stolen.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne person is explicitly mentioned in the article: Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R). Citing a report from The Washington Post\u2019s Amy Gardner that Trump pressured Raffensperger to overturn Georgia\u2019s narrow win for President Biden in the days before the Capitol siege, the impeachment article says:\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021, followed his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct the certification of the results of the 2020 Presidential election. Those prior efforts included a phone call on January 2, 2021, during which President Trump urged the secretary of state of Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to overturn the Georgia Presidential election results and threatened Secretary Raffensperger if he failed to do so.\n\nRaffensperger has been very public in his comments about the baselessness of Trump\u2019s claims. And if there\u2019s one person who could attest to his long-running effort to feed into the conspiracy theories that motivated those who stormed the Capitol, it\u2019s probably Raffensperger.\n\nThat might not answer the incitement question, but he is directly cited in the impeachment article, and he has been willing to speak his mind, despite his shared party affiliation with and past support for Trump \u2014 along with the fact that he has probably torpedoed his political career for his trouble.\n\n6. Dustin Stockton\n\nThis name might not be familiar to many people, but when it comes to the how the Jan. 6 rally became the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol, it\u2019s entirely relevant.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStockton is an ally of pardoned former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon and a former Breitbart News employee. He told the New York Times last week that the rally at the Ellipse had been meant to stay there until the counting of the electoral college votes was completed, but that he was surprised to learn on Jan. 6 that the rally then included a march to the Capitol.\n\nHow did that happen? Pretty much anybody who could speak to the evolution of the Ellipse rally into the siege would be important.\n\n7. Trump\n\nYes, Democrats have requested this. And no, he won\u2019t show up. But that doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t be vital. The question here, after all, is whether Trump incited his supporters. Hearing his argument about why that isn\u2019t the case would be helpful.\n\nAD\n\nAnother pertinent question: What did he know and when about the Capitol riot as it was progressing? Even as news reports showed the ugly scenes, Trump doubled down on his criticisms of Vice President Mike Pence for not unilaterally trying to overturn the results of the election. His tweet on Pence, in fact, came just after reports indicated Pence had been escorted off the Senate floor for his safety. Trump also released a video hours later telling his supporters to be peaceful and to leave, but also expressing his \u201clove\u201d for them.\n\nAD\n\nThe charge is incitement, but Trump\u2019s posture toward the scenes as they were taking place is relevant to understanding if this was an outcome he desired.\n\n8. Mark Meadows\n\nTo the above question, perhaps nobody could speak to it as well as the White House chief of staff. He was with Trump as it was unfolding, as video showed. He was also in regular touch with military leaders, according to Kash Patel, the chief of staff to then-Defense Secretary Christopher Miller.\n\nMeadows has also defended Trump, including Sunday, by saying Trump offered military help but that it was rejected. \u201cSome of those decisions weren\u2019t made appropriately, in my opinion, and those decisions did not come from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,\u201d Meadows told Fox News. \u201cIt came from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201d\n\n9. Constitutionality witnesses\n\nBy all accounts, the Trump defense will rest upon the constitutionality of the proceedings. As mentioned above, 45 GOP senators voted that the proceedings themselves violated the Constitution, and Republicans have repeatedly signified that they would rather debate process issues than Trump\u2019s actual conduct.\n\nBut Democrats might not want to concede the point. The fact is that even many conservative legal experts have argued that an impeachment trial of a former president is constitutional. Among them: Steven Calabresi, the co-founder of the Federalist Society, and Charles Fried, a solicitor general under President Ronald Reagan.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/02-13-2021/t_4edd07335df04457aa32b24f50a728ed_name_thumb.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9487609267234802}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Facing threats by Trump \u2019s legal team to try to call hundreds of witnesses , they settled for a sworn statement from Beutler , who said Trump had told House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R - Calif. ) during the Capitol riot , \u201c Well , Kevin , I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are \u201d.

With fresh security video, the managers were able to highlight the viciousness of the rioters and how close things came to an even worse disaster. Even though everyone in the Senate chamber had lived through the attacks when they happened, the video timeline assembled by the House managers brought the dangers of the day back with unexpected force.\n\nThursday\u2019s presentations had different purposes. One was to show that what happened on Jan. 6 was not a one-off event, but an almost predictable culmination of years of behavior by a president whose exhortations to attack his rivals were absorbed and then acted upon by his loyalists. A second was to remind everyone of the lingering and lasting effects of the trauma on lawmakers, their staffs, law enforcement officers and Capitol support employees. A third was to anticipate and offer a prebuttal to the defense from Trump\u2019s lawyers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Friday, the former president\u2019s legal team had its turn. Based on its performance during Tuesday\u2019s opening statements, Trump and Republicans supporting him had reason to be nervous.\n\nMuch of what they offered Friday was repetitive and not directly on point. They used fewer than three of the 16 hours allotted to them. And they stumbled as they tried to answer some of the senators\u2019 questions. But overall, their presentation likely was adequate to satisfy Republicans with a predeliction to acquit the former president.\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s team began and ended its rebuttal on the defensive. House Democrats, led by Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), had stitched together a case that was both legally compelling and viscerally gut-wrenching, befitting the shocking events that brought the former president into the dock of the Senate for the second time in little more than a year.\n\nNothing was left to the imagination. No ground went unexplored. The managers\u2019 case included a review of Trump\u2019s efforts to poison the ground before the election by claiming that the only way he could lose was by fraud. The managers focused on the days immediately after the election, when Trump lodged the first claims that the election was being stolen, long before all the ballots had been counted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey focused on the wild claims made by Trump\u2019s lawyers, led by Rudolph W. Giuliani, that included assertions of widespread fraud based on outlandish conspiracy theories for which there was no evidence and flat-out falsehoods about ghost voters and the like. They pointed to his efforts to force Georgia officials to overturn the results there. They made clear that nearly everything Trump and his team said was quickly internalized by supporters \u2014 the gospel according to their ultimate leader.\n\nThey focused on Trump\u2019s appeals to supporters to rally in Washington on Jan. 6 and on the pressure he applied to Vice President Mike Pence to block the ratification of the electoral college vote that day (though Pence had no constitutional authority to do so). They pointed repeatedly to Trump\u2019s speech on Jan. 6, interspersing his words with the voices of the mob invading the Capitol and shouting, \u201cFight for Trump,\u201d while claiming they were there because he had asked them to be there.\n\nThey showed a president with no remorse as the Capitol was under assault, and who took no action as his vice president and congressional leaders were in hiding in the building as the rioters chanted \u201cHang Pence\u201d and \u201cWhere are you, Nancy?\u201d \u2014 a reference to the House speaker. They reiterated again and again that the president did nothing to call off the attack as it was happening and in a video that day continued to claim the election had been stolen.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey focused on the years of rhetoric by the president encouraging supporters at rallies to rough up protesters; on his claim that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d when white supremacists descended on Charlottesville in 2017 for a rally that ended with the death of Heather Heyer.\n\nThey highlighted his repeated attacks on Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), who had dared to criticized him, as armed protesters descended on the Capitol in Lansing and even after she was the target of an alleged assassination plot.\n\nIt was a presentation both of the moment \u2014 the events leading up to and including Jan. 6 \u2014 and one that showed what the managers described as a pattern and practice of Trump\u2019s behavior that inevitably led to the storming of the Capitol.\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps it won\u2019t matter what kind of defense Trump\u2019s legal team presented. Twice now, 44 Republicans have voted against even proceeding with the trial on the grounds that it is unconstitutional to hold an impeachment trial for a president who is no longer in office. Although six Republican senators voted to go ahead with the trial, it is not known how many of the six are prepared to vote to convict Trump. Even if they all are, the House managers need 11 more Republicans \u2014 a high hill to climb.\n\nAD\n\nBut do all 44 Republican senators who voted to question the constitutionality of the trial truly believe that a former official cannot be tried? Or were those votes merely signs that they would rather decide the case on a legal debate rather than on squarely facing the conduct of the former president? Were those two procedural votes based on their own reading of the Constitution or on mere party loyalty and fear of a man who still has the capacity to make their lives difficult?\n\nAfter all, they have seen the swift response by rank-and-file Republicans to any who stray from adherence to Trump \u2014 from Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) to Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.) and even Sen. Bill Cassidy (La.), who after hearing the two sides argue the constitutionality of the trial found the Trump lawyers\u2019 argument so underwhelming that he voted to go ahead.\n\nAD\n\nThe presentation by the House managers made finding exit ramps more difficult for GOP senators, but Trump\u2019s team tried to provide them. They argued that the speech Trump delivered on Jan. 6 is protected by the First Amendment. They said that the House managers failed to prove that what he did meets the definition of inciting an insurrection. They used endless clips of Democrats using the word \u201cfight\u201d to suggest that Trump\u2019s use of the same word had no ominous meaning, though the context was entirely different.\n\nAD\n\nStill, Republicans will have to stretch themselves to conclude that, while those who invaded the Capitol face criminal prosecution, the person who brought them to Washington, stirred them to anger with lies about a stolen election and did nothing to stop the riot while it was underway should pay no price whatsoever. If the price of conviction at trial and possible prohibition from ever running again seems too steep, they have the option of imposing the far lesser penalty of a censure by the Senate once the trial is over.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NA3MEZDMXAI6XJTO4JYEN2PITA.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.8043698668479919}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Wednesday \u2019s presentations by the House managers asked everyone in the Senate chamber and beyond to confront anew the horrors of the attack on the Capitol. \n\n Still , Trump \u2019s team began and ended its rebuttal on the defensive."}, "category": "Business"}, {"id": "8be3193a-9f48-4a5c-8e21-b1dd7ca68aa1", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "Supreme Court says Alabama cannot execute inmate without his pastor present", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-says-alabama-cannot-execute-inmate-without-his-pastor-present/2021/02/12/e1fb6674-6d24-11eb-9ead-673168d5b874_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_politics", "description": "Justice Amy Coney Barrett joins with court\u2019s liberals in saying states must allow spiritual advisers at time of death.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 17:56:00 EST", "body": "But the request divided the court\u2019s conservative majority.

Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said they would have as well, because Alabama\u2019s ban is nondiscriminatory and, in Kavanaugh\u2019s words, \u201cserves the State\u2019s compelling interests in ensuring the safety, security and solemnity of the execution room.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut he added that the rest of the court did not agree, and other death-penalty states should take heed.\n\nStates wanting to avoid months or years of litigation, Kavanaugh wrote, \u201cshould figure out a way to allow spiritual advisors into the execution room, as other States and the Federal Government have done. Doing so not only would satisfy inmates\u2019 requests, but also would avoid still further delays and bring long overdue closure for victims\u2019 families.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlabama Attorney General Steve Marshall declined to comment through a spokesman. Smith\u2019s execution will probably be postponed at least a month.\n\nOne of Smith\u2019s attorneys, Anand Agneshwar, said states should not be resistant.\n\n\u201cThe issue really comes up only when somebody makes a sincere request for this accommodation,\u201d Agneshwar said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how states can come up with a good reason not to allow it,\u201d especially since it is allowed in federal executions.\n\nAD\n\nThe Alabama case has a backstory that has bitterly cleaved the court.\n\nIn 2019, it split 5 to 4 to allow Alabama\u2019s execution of a Muslim inmate, Domineque Ray, although he protested that the state only allowed a state-employed Christian chaplain to accompany inmates in their final moments before execution.\n\nAD\n\nSome conservatives in the majority later said it was because Ray had filed his complaint too late. But the order drew fire from both the left and religious conservatives on the right.\n\nKagan wrote a stinging dissent in the case, saying \u201cRay has put forward a powerful claim that his religious rights will be violated at the moment the state puts him to death.\u201d\n\nA couple of months later, the court stopped an execution in Texas because the state said it could not accommodate a Buddhist inmate\u2019s request for a spiritual adviser to be with him in the death chamber.\n\nAD\n\nAt the time, Texas allowed only Christian and Muslim chaplains to attend executions. Kavanaugh wrote that the government \u201cmay not discriminate against religion generally or against particular religious denominations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut he said states could solve the problem by excluding all outsiders from the death chamber.\n\nAlabama changed its policy as a result. But Smith said that did not satisfy a federal law protecting the rights of inmates \u2014 the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act \u2014 and a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit agreed.\n\nKagan said the lower court was right and Alabama\u2019s defense that it was concerned about security did not hold up; until the recent change, it required chaplains to be present, she noted.\n\n\u201cAlabama\u2019s policy substantially burdens Smith\u2019s exercise of religion\u201d and leaves inmates \u201cto die without spiritual attendance,\u201d Kagan wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQuoting from Smith\u2019s complaint, she added \u201cSmith understands his minister\u2019s presence as \u2018integral to [his] faith\u2019 and \u2018essential to [his] spiritual search for redemption.\u2019 His pastor, Smith says, will not only \u2018relieve his struggle as he passes,\u2019 but also help him \u2018properly express to God his repentance.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSmith was scheduled to receive a lethal injection at a south Alabama prison for the decades-old murder of 22-year-old Sharma Ruth Johnson in Birmingham.\n\nSmith, along with others, abducted Johnson at gunpoint from an ATM. They later used her card to steal $80 from her account and then took her to a cemetery, where Smith shot her in the back of the head.\n\nAD\n\nThe justices vacated another stay issued by the 11th Circuit related to Smith\u2019s intellectual capacity and a challenge to the method of execution.\n\nAD\n\nBarrett\u2019s role in capital punishment cases has been closely watched not only because of the impact a new justice can make, but also because of past comments about her Catholic faith and capital punishment.\n\nIn 1998, she co-wrote a law review article titled \u201cCatholic Judges in Capital Cases\u201d that described the tensions. She suggested judges who felt they could not be impartial because of their faith should recuse and wrote, \u201cCatholic judges (if they are faithful to the teaching of their church) are morally precluded from enforcing the death penalty.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs a nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit and later the Supreme Court, Barrett said she would be reluctant to enter an order of execution if she were a trial judge, but it was different for appellate judges considering issues of law in the case of someone already on death row.\n\nAD\n\nSince she joined the high court, she has consistently voted with conservatives to deny stay requests from death row inmates as the Trump administration made a concerted effort to revive the federal death penalty. The federal government executed 13 people, which as Sotomayor noted in one dissent, is \u201cthree times as many people in the last six months than it had in the previous six decades.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RXGYXVDNQUI6XH4AHV3ENTQ3YA.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.7584493160247803}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "For the first time since she joined the court in October , Justice Amy Coney Barrett sided with liberal colleagues in a capital punishment case , saying federal law requires states to make accommodations for prisoners like Smith.

"description": "In her new book, Anna Malaika Tubbs shines a light on the strong women behind three influential Black leaders", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 19:00:00 +0000", "body": "The women have much in common: They were born within a few years of one another; they all married men trained in the church; their lives spanned the 20th century; all three outlived their sons. And yet they were very different from each other.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLouise Langdon Little, who became the mother of Malcolm X, was Caribbean and biracial. \u201cThe exact details of her conception have been lost to history,\u201d Tubbs notes, but it is believed that her mother was raped by a White man. Sadly, this was not uncommon, Tubbs reminds us: \u201cThe effects of slavery . . . the constant control of Black women\u2019s bodies through sexual violence, was universal, far after emancipation.\u201d\n\nLouise migrated to Canada in 1917. She met Earl Little, a Baptist minister, at a Universal Negro Improvement Association meeting. The UNIA was founded by activist Marcus Garvey, a fellow West Indian. Louise and Earl married and worked as field organizers, promoting Garvey\u2019s call for Black independence in American cities. The Littles had seven children together. Louise served as branch secretary and wrote for the Negro World newspaper and spoke at least three languages: English, French and Patois. Louise Langdon Little died in 1991.\n\nEmma Berdis Jones Baldwin, who became the mother of James Baldwin, was born on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore. She left the Jim Crow South for Philadelphia, and later, New York, during the Great Migration. In 1924, she had a baby, out of wedlock, named James Arthur Jones. She married David Baldwin, a preacher in the Pentecostal tradition and the two of them had eight more children together.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf these three women, Berdis \u201chad the least in terms of money and education,\u201d Tubbs points out. Her husband was paranoid and abusive and had trouble supporting his family. Berdis committed him to a mental institution, while she was pregnant with their ninth child, and he died shortly thereafter, in 1943. Emma Berdis died in 1999.\n\nAlberta Williams King, who became the mother of Martin Luther King Jr., was born in Atlanta in 1904. Her family had resources. Her father, the Rev. Adam Daniel Williams, was one of the founders of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP and the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church. Alberta was the most educated of the three mothers, attending Spelman Seminary, the Hampton Normal and Industrial Institute, and Morris Brown College. She married Baptist preacher Michael King, and they had three children together.\n\nAlberta was not allowed to make the most of her education. \u201cAt the time, there was also a law that kept married women from teaching,\u201d writes Tubbs. \u201cThis \u2018marriage bar\u2019 . . . lacked any logic; it was simply in place to restrict middle-class, educated women and it was not fully terminated until 1964 with the passing of the Civil Rights Act.\u201d Alberta focused, instead, on tutoring her husband, establishing women\u2019s coalitions and directing the children\u2019s choir.\n\nAll three women lived through the Harlem Renaissance, the Great Migration, the Great Depression and the civil rights movement. They knew the consequences of the women\u2019s suffragist movement, when White suffragists rejected Black women in 1920. They walked in the shadows of other great Black women, Tubbs asserts, including Harriet Tubman, Ida B. Wells, Rosa Parks, Mary McLeod Bethune and Mamie Till, Emmett Till\u2019s mother. They endured sociologist Edward Franklin Frazier\u2019s assertion that Black women in the 1930s resisted subordination and male authority, \u201cemasculating their husbands and failing to fulfill their womanly duties.\u201d They were subject to insulting distortions of Black people, including the \u201cMammy,\u201d the \u201cJezebel,\u201d the \u201cPickaninny\u201d and the \u201cWelfare Queen,\u201d in popular culture. They survived White sociologist Daniel Patrick Moynihan\u2019s 1965 claim that households run by Black mothers were inadequate compared to White families.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEach woman endured tremendous personal loss. The Little marriage was tumultuous, and Earl Little died in a suspicious streetcar accident in 1931. Louise was forced to go on welfare, certified insane and committed to the Kalamazoo State Hospital for more than 25 years. She was released just before the assassination of her son Malcolm X. Alberta lost not one but two sons: After Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination in 1968, her other son, A.D. King, died in a mysterious drowning the following year. Emma Berdis\u2019s son, James Baldwin, became an amazing artist and activist and lived into the 1980s, but died of cancer of the esophagus.\n\nEndurance and resilience are the themes here. In the face of racism, sexism and tremendous violence, these three mothers survive. They are honored, in these pages, as the extraordinary women they were, in their own right. This ambitious book reframes African American history, supplying the female Black experience as a much-needed perspective.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLisa Page is co-editor of \u201cWe Wear the Mask: 15 True Stories of Passing in America.\u201d She is an assistant professor of English at George Washington University.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nThe Three Mothers: How the Mothers of Martin Luther King, Jr. Malcolm X, and James Baldwin Shaped a Nation\n\nBy Anna Malaika Tubbs", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/K2NWLKSAPMI6XC6AVYKVX3SK74.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9997769594192505}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "AD \n\n AD \n\n Louise Langdon Little , who became the mother of Malcolm X , was Caribbean and biracial \u201c.

The Kreeger Museum (on Foxhall Road), and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum followed.\n\nIn December, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) announced that all museums in the city would be closed from Dec. 24 to at least Jan. 22. After Bowser\u2019s order, the National Museum of Women in the Arts announced it would be closed through March 2, \u201cout of an abundance of caution for the well-being of our visitors, volunteers and staff.\u201d Of Washington\u2019s larger museums, only the International Spy Museum and the Museum of the Bible planned to reopen in January. Outdoor areas, however, have begun to welcome the public again: The National Gallery of Art\u2019s Sculpture Garden reopens on Feb. 14, and the private Glenstone Museum opens its 300 acres of art to the public on March 4.\n\nSome museums, sculpture gardens and zoos across the area remain open, for now, with stringent social distancing precautions. Remember to check websites and social media, as many attractions are operating with shortened hours, and not all exhibits may be open. \u201cThou shalt wear a face mask\u201d is one of the Museum of the Bible\u2019s \u201cCovid Commandments,\u201d while the Spy Museum provides a \u201cspy gadget,\u201d or stylus, for use with touch screens, elevator buttons and any other surface that might spread germs.\n\nThis list will be updated as more institutions announce their plans.\n\nFully reopened\n\nAmerican Visionary Art Museum: The eccentric Baltimore museum, which champions the art of everyday people with more passion than training, reopened Sept. 25 after more than six months of closure. Capacity is limited to twenty-five percent, and purchase of advance timed tickets is required. All galleries are open, including \u201cThe Science and Mystery of Sleep,\u201d an exhibition featuring \u201cfantastical, handmade bedrooms created by three visionary artists as personal refuge\u201d according to the museum, which opened in October. Open Wednesday to Sunday. $9.95-$15.95.\n\nArtechouse: Melding interactive art with cutting-edge technology, Artechouse is a much different experience than the museums a few blocks away on the Mall. Its latest exhibit, \u201cCrystalline,\u201d which opened Oct. 15, is an homage to Pantone 19-4052 Classic Blue, which the Pantone Color Institute dubbed 2020\u2032s color of the year. Artechouse says this particular shade \u201cbrings a sense of peace and tranquility to the human spirit,\u201d with the exhibit taking the form of \u201can exploration through an illusory, blue-hued castle.\u201d Capacity is limited, and timed-admission tickets are required. Open daily. $17-$24; $5 discount for advance purchases.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nB&O Railroad Museum: A museum known for hands-on activities, including actual train rides on the historic One Mile Express, might not be the first place you think of going right now, but Baltimore\u2019s B&O Railroad Museum is working hard to keep the facility safe. Masks and social distancing are required, including limiting seating and arranging spacing on the train. The children\u2019s area is \u201ccleaned throughout the day and is deep-cleaned each night,\u201d while high-touch areas are cleaned multiple times a day. Open daily. $12-$20.\n\nInternational Spy Museum: The museum, which moved to an expansive new building in L\u2019Enfant Plaza in 2019, reopens on Jan. 23 with a limited capacity and extra distancing. (The museum now recommends a minimum of two hours to explore.) Many of the interactive elements have been modified to reduce contact, but some elements are temporarily closed \u2014 including the sections in which visitors crawl through an air duct, and attempt to escape East Berlin by hiding in a Trabant. However, staff members have created alternatives in the space: The Trabant on display has a mannequin demonstrating the contortions needed to fit into a hidden space in the car. Open on weekends and holidays in January and February, and plans to resume daily operations in March. $16.95-$24.95. Ages 6 and younger free.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMuseum of the Bible: The Museum of the Bible plans to reopen on Jan. 29. Procedures to limit contact and encourage social distancing have been in effect since the museum initially reopened in June: Most of the interactive exhibits have remained open, along with the Milk and Honey Cafe, while the Virtual Reality Tour of the Lands of the Bible and the hands-on children\u2019s area are closed. Visitors receive styluses to use with touch screens, and are asked to download museum maps to their phones instead of picking up paper copies. Advance tickets are recommended. Open daily. $9.99-$19.99. Ages 6 and younger free.\n\nNational Aquarium: Sharks, puffins and golden lion tamarins continue to delight generations of visitors at the National Aquarium in Baltimore\u2019s Inner Harbor. The aquarium reopened July 1 with new social distancing policies: Capacity is limited to 25 percent of the building\u2019s occupancy, admission is by timed-entry tickets, and some exhibits, such as the touch pools, are temporarily closed. Visitors must wear masks and have their temperatures checked. Open daily. $29.95-$39.95. Ages 2 and younger free.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPartially reopened\n\nMaryland Zoo: It\u2019s hard to say who was more excited about the Maryland Zoo\u2019s June reopening: the human visitors or the animals they\u2019d come to see. \u201cOn the first day, the penguins were all lined up against the glass,\u201d a Zoo spokesperson told the Baltimore Sun. \u201cThe chimps were lined up, too. I think visitors provide them a little entertainment.\u201d Among the Zoo\u2019s new precautions: Requiring timed-entry reservations to prevent overcrowding, a limit of 25 percent of capacity for indoor areas, such as the Giraffe House, and mandating a one-way flow through the grounds. Open daily. $18-$22.\n\nMount Vernon: George Washington\u2019s historic estate became one of the first major attractions to reopen in the Washington area in June 2020. Social-distancing rules mean visitors must reserve tickets for timed guided tours of the first floor of the mansion, and the upper floors remain closed. Still, the family-friendly museum is open, minus the theaters and hands-on history area, and all 160 acres of the grounds are accessible, including the gardens, slave cabins, farming demonstrations and the first president\u2019s tomb. (The distillery is closed, and will open in spring.) Capacity is limited, so advance ticket purchase is recommended. Open daily. $10-$18. Ages 5 and younger free.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWorkhouse Arts Center: The sprawling campus, formerly the Lorton Correctional Complex, is home to artist studios and hosts special events, including drive-in movies and comedy. The Lucy Burns Museum, which opened in early 2020, tells the stories of the suffragists who were sent here after being arrested for picketing and protesting at the White House in 1917. The brutal treatment they suffered, including assaults by guards on what became known as \u201cThe Night of Terror,\u201d shocked the public. Exhibitions also discuss the site\u2019s later years as a prison. The museum is open Saturdays from noon to 5 p.m., while studios are open from noon to 5 p.m. Friday through Sunday. Free.\n\nOutdoor areas only\n\nPlease note that access to facilities, such as restrooms and cafes, is limited. Check before going.\n\nAD\n\nAnnmarie Sculpture Garden and Arts Center: It\u2019s not often that a walk in the woods leads to a modern sculpture by Jules Olitski, Minoru Niizuma or Gerhard Marcks, but that\u2019s what makes the Annmarie Sculpture Garden in Solomons, Md., one of the area\u2019s most engaging art experiences. Visitors to the 30-acre sculpture garden follow trails winding past clearings and under the trees. Sometimes the art is next to the path, and sometimes it\u2019s first seen from a distance. With areas for children, including a riverside playhouse; plant displays; and a separate \u201cWomen\u2019s Walk\u201d looking at bronze female forms, this is a garden that appeals to many different audiences. Family art classes have temporarily moved outside, while other art classes and events are now held virtually. Open daily. Suggested donation $5.\n\nGlenstone: The much-buzzed-about Potomac art museum reopens as \u201can outdoor experience\u201d on March 4, with visitors allowed to stroll the 300 acres of grounds and admire sculptures by Richard Serra, Michael Heizer and Jeff Koons, among other contemporary artists. The indoor Pavilions, Gallery and Environmental Center remain closed, as do the dining areas. Tickets for visits in March and April can be reserved beginning at 10 a.m. on Monday, Feb. 15. Open Thursday through Sunday. Free, reservations required. Tickets can be reserved up to one month in advance, with a new batch of tickets released at 10 a.m. on the first of the month. (For example, tickets for the month of May are released on April 1.)\n\nHirshhorn Sculpture Garden: After five months of closure, the Hirshhorn\u2019s sunken Sculpture Garden reopened on the Mall on Aug. 17. Two new works have joined more than 30 pieces already on display: \u201cWe Come in Peace,\u201d a female figure with five faces that stands more than 12-feet-tall by Huma Bhabha \u2014 whose title references the 1951 sci-fi film \u201cThe Day the Earth Stood Still\u201d \u2014 and Sterling Ruby\u2019s \u201cDouble Candle,\u201d a pair of monumental bronze candles. While other Smithsonian museums shuttered again, the Hirshhorn\u2019s garden will be open daily, subject to capacity limits, and masks must be worn by all visitors aged 6 and older. The museum\u2019s plaza and interior remain closed. Open daily. Free.\n\nKenilworth Aquatic Gardens: Known for the summer display of lotuses and waterlilies, this large collection of water gardens and marshland is one of Washington\u2019s outdoor treasures throughout the year. As with many parks, portions of the Aquatic Gardens are closed to encourage social distancing, and the restrooms are unavailable. But the river walk and other trails are open, and photo opportunities abound. Open daily. Free.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNational Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden: The National Gallery\u2019s beloved sculpture garden on the Mall reopens on Feb. 14, while the Gallery\u2019s East and West buildings remain closed. There are shorter hours (11 a.m. to 4 p.m., daily), limited capacity (a maximum of 271 visitors) and a new traffic flow, but those are minor inconveniences when you just want to enjoy fresh air and art by Tony Smith, Barry Flanagan and Louise Bourgeois. The ice skating rink won\u2019t be available this season, but the Pavilion Cafe serves snacks, coffee, beer and wine. Open daily. Free.\n\nU.S. National Arboretum: After two reopening periods with limited hours, the Arboretum\u2019s 446 acres of gardens, trees and trails are now open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Some attractions, such as the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum and the Visitors Center, remain closed. Open daily.

The highest praise that can be bestowed on his book is that it will remind readers of a cloak-and-dagger tale by John Le Carr\u00e9 with an armature of fascinating historical annotation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGorenberg is a veteran journalist and historian based in Jerusalem, the author of three previous books about aspects of the Middle East (\u201cThe Unmaking of Israel,\u201d \u201cThe Accidental Empire\u201d and \u201cThe End of Days\u201d), a contributing columnist for The Washington Post, and a longtime contributor to the New York Times Magazine, the New York Review of Books, the Atlantic and Haaretz.\n\nFacts on the ground in North Africa figure prominently in \u201cWar of Shadows,\u201d but equally important is the work that was conducted in an English country house called Bletchley Park, where the secret messages that passed between Berlin and its battlefield commanders were decoded and selectively shared with Allied counterparts. But the deciding factor was Winston Churchill\u2019s conviction that the decision to defend British primacy in the Middle East was \u201cat once awful and right.\u201d According to Gorenberg, \u201cIt was a wager that changed the shape of the war, and of the Middle East then and after.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Gorenberg allows us to see that a Middle Eastern version of the Great Game was conducted in parallel with armed combat. Nazi plotters imagined that Egyptian dissidents could be persuaded to \u201cswitch to the German side.\u201d The same sentiment can be detected in the recollections of Anwar Sadat, then a young officer in an Egyptian artillery brigade that was serving with the British army in the campaign against Benito Mussolini\u2019s expeditionary force. \u201cOur enemy was primarily, if not solely, Great Britain,\u201d Sadat later explained.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe code-breakers at Bletchley Park confirmed the strategic ambitions of the Axis in the Middle East. Bombers, fighters and transport planes were being sent from German-occupied Greece, \u201cwith Iraq markings or no markings at all,\u201d for service against the Allies. After all, as Gorenberg points out, \u201cboth Iraq and the Vichy-ruled territories of Syria and Lebanon were fully aligned with the Axis.\u201d\n\nPalestine, then ruled by Britain under a mandate from the League of Nations, was also at stake. When Italian bombers attacked Haifa and Tel Aviv, the former grand mufti of Jerusalem sent his congratulations to Mussolini. By contrast, the Jewish leadership in Palestine urged Jews to enlist in the British army, and an elite unit known as the Palmach shared its soldiers with the Special Operations Executive. Meir Yaari, a leader of the kibbutz movement, observed that \u201cthese days no fear is an exaggeration.\u201d Yet Gorenberg also notices that Moshe Shertok, a future prime minister of Israel, saw a distinction in the early years of the war between the Nazi invasion of Poland that had already happened and the Nazi invasion of Palestine that was feared in the future: \u201cIt\u2019s possible that there will be atrocities here,\u201d Shertok said.\n\n\u201cOn that,\u201d Gorenberg writes in a heartbreaking aside, \u201cintelligence was entirely lacking.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe dramatis personae that appear in Gorenberg\u2019s book from the outset range from world historical figures like Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt and Adolf Hitler to a young naval intelligence officer named Ian Fleming, whose wartime experiences inspired him to create the most famous spy of all. Above all, Gorenberg restores to the historical record various men and woman who have been mostly overlooked and always undervalued, including the remarkable Hermione, Countess of Ranfurly, an English aristocrat who served a consequential role in the Special Operations Executive.\n\nCountess Hermione is an example of exactly what makes \u201cWar of Shadows\u201d such a colorful and compelling book of history. She was met with skepticism when she first volunteered for the war effort: \u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to believe that a countess can type,\u201d said one brigadier. As it turned out, she was stationed in an office that was stocked with guns, ammunition and gold, and she directed the efforts of commandos in a shooting war.\n\n\u201cWe sent little boats up the Danube to lay mines,\u201d she wrote of her wartime efforts. \u201cWe sent gentlemen forth with wirelesses in suitcases and instructions to blow up certain bridges.\u201d\n\nOnce in action, however, the Countess demonstrated one facility that her male comrades-in-arms lacked; she carried a Colt revolver in her girdle and smuggled secret papers in her bra.\n\nWar of Shadows\n\nCodebreakers, Spies, and the\n\nSecret Struggle\n\nto Drive the Nazis From the Middle East\n\nBy Gershom Gorenberg", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EQ4SZVDEV4I6XOVYOB7YO2OXQU.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9994374513626099}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "But the deciding factor was Winston Churchill \u2019s conviction that the decision to defend British primacy in the Middle East was \u201c at once awful and right \u201d. \n\n \u201c War of Shadows \u201d is based on meticulous and exhaustive research that ranged from \u201c archives in places from Tel Aviv to Palo Alto to the homes of the children and grandchildren of people whose names have been forgotten though they changed the direction of history \u201d."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "411ccab5-6060-4f34-abc0-49ed75530460", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "The tale of a bass player, sonic epiphanies and a quest to save \u2018real music\u2019", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/the-tale-of-a-bass-player-sonic-epiphanies-and-a-quest-to-save-real-music/2021/02/10/9155bc36-6178-11eb-9430-e7c77b5b0297_story.html", "description": "Jazz-bluegrass musician Victor L. Wooten offers insights in an action-adventure fable.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 13:00:00 +0000", "body": "Victor L. Wooten is this sort of musician. A founding member of the jazz-bluegrass group Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, he is a superb bassist, a high practitioner of technique, tone and feel. Over the past few decades he has also been known as an educator, starting (with his wife, Holly) the Victor Wooten Center for Music and Nature camp in Tennessee. He is also a writer. His first book, \u201cThe Music Lesson,\u201d published in 2006, is narrated by a young bass player at a creative impasse \u2014 skilled, but easily frustrated, and more easily impressed. He wakes from a nap to find a tall man in his living room. The man\u2019s name is Michael. Eventually, we learn that the student\u2019s name is Victor. Michael will become Victor\u2019s mentor in music.\n\nVictor didn\u2019t invite Michael. Or did he? \u201cI teach nothing,\u201d Michael proclaims in that book\u2019s early pages, \u201cbecause there is nothing to be taught. You already know everything you need to know, but you asked me to come, so here I am.\u201d Still, the core of \u201cThe Music Lesson\u201d proceeds systematically. Michael breaks down music into 10 elements, which serve as the basis for each chapter. These include notes (which he finds \u201coverrated\u201d), dynamics and phrasing, but also space \u2014 the space between the notes \u2014 and listening.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe book\u2019s sequel, \u201cThe Spirit of Music,\u201d is a kind of action-adventure fable involving Victor, Michael, and a number of other friends and teachers. There is Ali, a former minister from a \u201csmall African village\u201d where he learned from an elite group called the Elders of Higher Learning; Seiko, a drummer from Japan who turned away from Taiko drumming to learn rock-and-roll; Uncle Clyde, who chose to live under a bridge in Nashville \u201cto do his work undetected and unnoticed\u201d; and Victor\u2019s student, Jonathan, with whom Victor spends a few good pages early in the book breaking down Willie Weeks\u2019s bass solo on \u201cVoices Inside (Everything Is Everything),\u201d from the Donny Hathaway \u201cLive\u201d album.\n\nVictor and his friends aren\u2019t necessarily all virtuosos. What they have in common is that they perceive, feel and communicate through music. They are in tune with what Ali defines as a more African than European attitude toward playing music, prioritizing the why of it before the what of it. \u201cAnyone can play \u2019cause everyone have Music inside,\u201d Ali explains to Victor, \u201cbut with the Elders, you must show your calling before they take you further. If they accept you \u2014 if Music accept you \u2014 then you learn true power.\u201d\n\nHere is the premise: Music \u2014 always capitalized and given feminine pronouns, and understood as a living entity \u2014 is sick and may be dying.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf what? Wooten doesn\u2019t really specify. This is not that kind of book. What kind of book is it? It\u2019s a bit like Carlos Castaneda\u2019s shamanist tales, a bit like tween fiction, a bit like websites on, say, sonic healing through principles of sacred geometry and \u2014 at its best \u2014 an enactment of epiphanies told in the ping-pong dialogue of its predecessor.\n\nVictor and his crew travel from Virginia to Nashville, evading and finally facing down a sinister force of silent enemies called the Phasers. The Phasers wear dark glasses and dark suits and have the power to render music inaudible, in the manner of noise-canceling headphones. In one of many mini-lessons throughout the book, Michael remarks that \u201cMusic brings people together, not only to feel, but to agree on what we feel.\u201d This is why the Phasers must destroy it.\n\nBut the Phasers must be working for someone, right? Or perhaps they represent a system or process \u2014 capitalism? Digitization? Algorithms?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAgain, this is not that kind of book, because Wooten is not that kind of writer. Mostly (but not entirely) directed toward musicians, it\u2019s a book that stands happily against traditional music pedagogy and canned notions of achievement. This is to its great credit. Your happiness as a reader will depend on how open you are to insights that recognize no coincidences, some of them from the crystal-indigo-rainbow file, as well as proposed, though not explained, secret-knowledge theories. If the metafictional Victor Wooten tends toward these theories, Ali tends toward them even more: For instance, he explains that a guitar is female because of its \u201chead, neck, curves, slim waist, and a womb in the middle where vibrations grow\u201d \u2014 and therefore, Jimi Hendrix\u2019s \u201cFoxy Lady\u201d is about his guitar. Or that the sixth note of the solf\u00e8ge scale is \u201cla,\u201d and the sixth note of the C major scale is A \u2014 so a-la \u2014 Allah!\n\nYour happiness as a reader may also depend on how wary you are when told that a cherished belief system is under secret attack, and around the phrases \u201creal musicians\u201d and \u201creal music,\u201d which come up just enough for a reader to suspect Wooten feels that some of the world\u2019s music is on the side of the Phasers. Which music? He doesn\u2019t tell \u2014 but presumably Willie Weeks is among the good guys, as is Hendrix, and Wooten\u2019s real-life cohort, and the visiting faculty at his music camps, who tend, like Wooten, to fall along the jazz-country-virtuoso spectrum. By the logic of this book, a lot of music made without \u201creal\u201d instruments \u2014 a lot of the music in the world right now, and some of the best \u2014 may start to look suspect. That\u2019s too bad. Wooten is an includer, not a delimiter; he\u2019s better at holistic teaching than veiled polemic.\n\nTHE SPIRIT OF MUSIC\n\nThe Lesson Continues\n\nBy Victor Wooten\n\nVintage.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4SHBUQTKHUI6XJTO4JYEN2PITA.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9996210932731628}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "His first book , \u201c The Music Lesson , \u201d published in 2006 , is narrated by a young bass player at a creative impasse \u2014 skilled , but easily frustrated , and more easily impressed.

He is an engaging writer, and an able and authoritative guide to the social history of mental illness. His writing is also often informed by his personal experiences, be it through his daughter, whose diagnosis of autism inspired his previous book on the subject, or his upbringing in a family of neurologists and psychiatrists.\n\nIn many ways, the autobiographical elements provide the book with a narrative structure, as they mirror larger trends in the history of American psychiatry. Grinker\u2019s great-grandfather Julius was a neurologist \u2014 and by all accounts an unpleasant man \u2014 who did not think much of psychiatry. His son, Roy Sr., rebelled against his father and, in a fitting irony, trained in psychoanalysis under Sigmund Freud himself. He would become an important figure in the evolution of psychiatry during and after World War II. Today, it is the grandson who has rebelled against the family, by becoming an anthropologist. But he seems to have atoned for it by marrying a psychiatrist and by spending much of his time grappling with the cultural dynamics of mental illness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo where, according to Grinker, does the stigma around mental illness come from? What is its history, and why does it remain so deeply entrenched?\n\nThe answers he provides are for the most part familiar, though no less disturbing for that. He argues, as the French philosopher Michel Foucault did before him, that the birth of stigma is inseparable from the birth of capitalism, of colonialism, of industrialization and of the slave trade. Stigma, in other words, consists of the act of branding, which, in the case of enslavement, could be literal. In creating labels such as \u201cmad,\u201d \u201cpauper,\u201d \u201csavage\u201d or \u201cqueer,\u201d the intent was to brand and isolate people whom the powerful and the privileged would rather not see, and from whose labor they could not profit. Indeed, when the first asylums were created, the poor and the mad were locked up together with the rest of society\u2019s outcasts. It is horrifying to think that, even today, for many people in America suffering a mental health crisis, their first port of call is the police \u2014 and that they are just as likely to end up in a prison as in a hospital.\n\nIt is no coincidence therefore that the burden of stigma fell above all on the marginalized and the oppressed. Idleness in the poor became neurasthenia in the rich. Hysteria in women, another excuse to suppress their sexuality, became shell-shock for men. In each case, the one label was stigmatized, the other accepted. To this day, the two most stigmatizing diagnoses in psychiatry \u2014 borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia \u2014 are reserved disproportionately for women and for people of color.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA brilliant insight that emerges again and again from the book, though never articulated as such, is that it is hard to imagine stigma without a constellation of beliefs that are distinctly Western and Judeo-Christian. If, for example, we insist on the fiction of a free will, on the separation of mind from body, on the existence of an autonomous self to which we ascribe agency and responsibility, it is impossible to develop a view of the world that does not stigmatize. The person who believes that all mental illness is purely psychological will blame herself for being weak and unable to pull herself together; the person who believes that her illness is biological might worry that she is cursed for life and that she might pass it on to her children. This last argument has been the justification for all past attempts at eugenics. But which view of mental illness is less stigmatizing?\n\nYet it is possible to look at things differently. It is possible to look at mental illness without the needless divisions of mind and body, psychology and biology, nature and culture. Consider, for example, the Jun/oansi people of Namibia, with whose culture Grinker seems intimately familiar. To them, the symptoms of psychosis are neither a disease of the body nor a fault of the mind. They are caused neither by genetics nor by negative or maladaptive thoughts. Rather, in attributing the symptoms of psychosis to spirits outside the body, the Jun/oansi seem to do away with all stigmatizing notions of personal responsibility. Such a view, which itself must reduce the burden of suffering, is also not in conflict with the use of medication to treat the symptoms. Indeed, the Jun/oansi do not consider medication a threat to their personal identities, as it is so often seen in the West. It is not a threat to their agency or their humanity. Instead, they seem to understand that it is much more important and pragmatic to treat the symptoms by whatever means possible. For, in mitigating the symptoms of mental illness, we also work to mitigate the stigma against it. They seem to understand that what matters most in the end is whether the patient is relieved of his suffering.\n\nThis is, of course, the more fundamental question: How do we grapple with the problem of human suffering \u2014 suffering that takes place in the mind and whose vocabulary is always cultural? Instead of philosophers and theologians, we now look to psychologists and psychiatrists to provide us with the keys to happiness or, if not that, at least relieve us of our pain. If suffering is human, and universal, the stories we tell of our suffering are anything but: They have always been personal and local, and contingent on culture.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat becomes clear, in reading Grinker\u2019s book, is that at several points in our recent history, our stories, far from making sense of suffering or easing it, have served to dehumanize people and deprive them of their dignity. This is the signature of stigma. If we grew better at recognizing it, perhaps, we might write better and richer stories of our own sorrows and, more important, those of others.\n\nNobody\u2019s Normal\n\nHow Culture Created the Stigma of Mental Illness\n\nBy Roy Richard Grinker", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7WOEBXTLEUI6XHVNM4YWRVNYOQ.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.776270866394043}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Grinker is an anthropologist by training and an expert on cultural perceptions of autism. \n\n AD \n\n AD \n\n So where , according to Grinker , does the stigma around mental illness come from ?."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "9be105eb-32e8-49e2-a409-827187d6356e", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "A Georgetown professor trades her classroom for a police beat", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/a-georgetown-professor-trades-her-classroom-for-a-police-beat/2021/02/11/15a2216a-5aa2-11eb-8bcf-3877871c819d_story.html", "description": "Rosa Brooks gets a firsthand look at the complicated world of urban policing.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 13:00:00 +0000", "body": "Georgetown law professor Rosa Brooks took this a step further, as recounted in her fascinating book \u201cTangled Up in Blue: Policing the American City.\u201d Brooks did not simply observe policing in America. This highly educated, tenured professor became the police. In her 40s, she successfully applied to D.C.\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department, completed training at the police academy and became a reserve police officer \u2014 a part-time position but one with all the rights of a full-time officer. She was assigned to 7-D, the D.C. police district with the highest concentration of Black residents, the highest concentration of poverty and the highest concentration of reported crime.\n\nThe first two of the book\u2019s three parts are framed around stories. Brooks recounts with vivid detail her experiences in the police academy and as an officer on patrol. She writes with the ease of a novelist rather than the characteristic precision of a legal scholar. To be clear, this is a good thing. Through her stories, Brooks avoids a didactic, finger-waving lecture on the virtues or failings of the criminal justice system. Instead, she paints word pictures of the tensions that bedevil urban policing. She allows the reader to reach conclusions about the state of policing, how race and class intersect with criminality, and whether the tools of policing address the needs of citizens. These stories, some of them \u201cunremittingly sad,\u201d others infuriating, let the reader see what Brooks calls \u201cthe secret city,\u201d an entire ecosystem in the capital that is invisible to most.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSignificantly, \u201cTangled Up in Blue\u201d tells two broader stories. While the primary story is a descriptive account of policing in D.C., a secondary story explains how and why Brooks traded her academic cap and gown for an expandable baton and gun. She describes herself as \u201cinfiltrating\u201d spaces her entire life. As a child, she infiltrated the boys-only games in her neighborhood. As a tween who preferred playing with boys, she infiltrated the girls\u2019 clique to learn how to put on makeup. As a high school senior, no longer interested in academic pursuits, she infiltrated Harvard University for college. And so it was, as a law professor, that Brooks infiltrated the very different world of police officers.\n\nThe two stories work together to show that race and class conspire to create conditions that leave poor, Black citizens with mostly bad choices in order to survive. These choices include committing crimes. But these crimes have victims, who are mostly poor and Black. The victims of crime require and request more policing. But more policing results in the negative interactions between the police and Black citizens that have sparked so many recent protests. This is what Harvard scholar Randall Kennedy calls a \u201cnegative good\u201d in his groundbreaking work, \u201cRace, Crime, and the Law.\u201d It is a \u201cgood\u201d for police to respond to neighborhoods with heightened crime, but a \u201cnegative\u201d when over-policing leads to harms to the very community law enforcement purports to protect. \u201cTangled Up in Blue\u201d puts this tension on full display.\n\nBrooks presents stories of officers caught in the middle of this tension. They are bound by laws and rules that force them to arrest a mother stealing food for her children, or a nurse who got into an inconsequential spat with her younger sister, or a teenage girl who was functionally abandoned by her mother and grandmother. In one passage, Brooks compares police officers to motorists, ensnared by the overinclusive reach of the motor vehicle code. In another, she explains that the profession does not tend to attract people who have \u201cpatience for ambiguity.\u201d Police work, she argues, exposes what a \u201ccomplicated\u201d moral universe we inhabit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile \u201cTangled Up in Blue\u201d does not, by any means, operate as an apologia for police, it at times elides the responsibility of officers in creating a \u201cDickensian\u201d narrative that Brooks abhors. She points out that both Black and White officers refer to Black citizens as \u201cf---ing animals\u201d and interact with them with a taught suspicion that the officer is almost always in mortal danger. Various officers nonchalantly use the descriptor \u201canimals\u201d in reference to 7-D. Yet it is not about race, they protest. To be sure, Brooks recognizes the \u201cotherization\u201d at play when officers peremptorily reject claims that racial bias insinuates itself into policing decisions by reducing 7-D residents to \u201canimals.\u201d Brooks acknowledges that we tend to \u201cexplain and justify our own biases,\u201d and she allows for the claim that crime-fighting in D.C. \u201ccan even make the most well-intentioned officers cynical.\u201d She reasons that racism is \u201cbaked so deeply into the system that it\u2019s invisible\u201d to the actors within that system. While that may be true, the ideal police department will endeavor to train its officers to consciously explore their own biases, since many of them \u2014 both Black and White \u2014 implicitly consider color to be a proxy for criminality.\n\n\u201cTangled Up in Blue\u201d works to address this concern in its third section. There, Brooks offers potential solutions. A byproduct of her time as a police officer is that it made her, in a sense, bilingual. She can understand and speak the language of the beat cop as well as the argot of the legal scholar.

He rarely saw him or spoke to him when he was young, and his grandfather died while he was in college. He knew that his father and his grandfather didn\u2019t get along, but why they didn\u2019t was unclear. The story he remembers hearing is that his grandfather wanted his father to become a partner in crime, but his dad refused, and their relationship withered.\n\nFamily stories are funny things, though, capable of morphing and shifting over the years u\n\nntil the unknowns outnumber the knowns. With \u201cSmalltime,\u201d Shorto traces his decision to learn the truth about his family\u2019s past, discover its long-buried secrets, and explore unforgotten slights and how decisions made decades and decades ago continue to leave their mark.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Shorto\u2019s story is not just about his family. It\u2019s also a social history of a place and time \u2014 industrial Pennsylvania from the early 20th century on \u2014 as it is being shaped by an influx of immigrants who are resented for their arrival, forced into the worst jobs and homes, and struggling to survive outside of an official America that makes their path harder at every opportunity.\n\n\u201cNo one with an Italian background had ever had a political job in the county,\u201d Shorto writes in a chapter about the roadblocks erected by establishment forces to keep immigrants from gaining any power. \u201cBack in 1911, the mayor of Johnstown made it a campaign promise that no one of Italian descent would work in his administration, not even as a street cleaner.\u201d\n\nThe growth of the mob in cities like Johns\u00adtown, Shorto posits, was largely a result of the denial of access to legal routes to power and wealth. If the front door wasn\u2019t open, the back door would have to do. For his grandfather, born to Italian immigrants in 1914, the back door meant helping his widowed mother make and sell moonshine during Prohibition, learning how to cheat and win at cards and dice, and eventually helping run a small-town illegal enterprise with ties to the big-city mobs in New York, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Shorto is successful at finding out what his grandfather did \u2014 as well as the affairs he had, the people he swindled, the drinking problem that tanked his illicit career \u2014 he struggles to learn more about just who his grandfather was. He admits to being \u201ccontinually thwarted\u201d in his efforts to learn more about his namesake\u2019s personality.\n\nThere are long talks with relatives, with men who knew his grandfather from his gangster days, with retired police officers and others, but no one can offer a penetrating look at the man who once was second-in-command of a criminal operation that controlled an entire city. Who really was Russ Shorto? It\u2019s hard to say.\n\nAt times, the flatness of his grandfather\u2019s character dampens the narrative. Why, a reader can justifiably ask, do I care about this person? The answer, unfortunately, is never fully apparent. A history of a gangster in a bygone time promises to be riveting, but there\u2019s not enough there there to make this a book you can\u2019t put down. The specter of an unsolved mob murder hangs over the story, hinting at a much deeper, darker tale. That too proves to be a promise that doesn\u2019t quite deliver.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat does pay off is a series of revelations that unfold in the book\u2019s final third, where Shorto focuses less on his grandfather and more on his father and their own strained relationship, and all that brought it about. Here the memoir becomes more personal and poignant, and less of a historical account weighted down by asides about process and efforts to corroborate stories.\n\nAs the hurts are revealed, they offer unexpected insights that traverse generations. The life of the grandfather explains the life of the father, which explains the life of the son. Shorto finds himself at his father\u2019s deathbed, expressing newfound gratitude and understanding.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he tells his father, \u201cfor showing me how to do history, which, it suddenly occurs to me, is nothing if it doesn\u2019t involve a consideration of how human beings try to balance their inevitable failures and stay afloat amid currents that are destined to sink them.\u201d\n\nSmalltime\n\nA Story of My Family and the Mob\n\nBy Russell Shorto", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T3YXHPTK5II6XJTO4JYEN2PITA.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9983546733856201}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "With \u201c Smalltime , \u201d Shorto traces his decision to learn the truth about his family \u2019s past , discover its long - buried secrets , and explore unforgotten slights and how decisions made decades and decades ago continue to leave their mark. \n\n AD \n\n AD \n\n But Shorto \u2019s story is not just about his family."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "f7902884-8015-40e3-9762-486ed1d76d4c", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "What floor?", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/interactive/2021/elevator-scenes-romance-movies-tv/", "description": "These intimate spaces offer the promise of privacy, but with a countdown.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 12:16:50 +0000", "body": "When was the last time any of us entered an elevator and didn\u2019t head for the corners, like toddlers in time out? Right now, keeping your air to yourself is the decent thing to do. But movies and television can transport us to a dimension where these confined spaces aren\u2019t a health hazard \u2014 they embody possibility.\n\nOn screen, an elevator can force people to get close or, when the doors open, to separate suddenly. There\u2019s the promise of privacy, but it comes with a countdown. Moving between floors, the characters\u2019 journey seems both improbable and inevitable.\n\nThese scenes border on feeling contrived. But if everything clicks \u2014 script, actors, direction, edit \u2014 the audience is kept just barely aware of the narrative gears. Plot mechanics feel weightless, like magic. We surrender to the pleasure of coincidence.\n\nRomance has two preconditions: timing and proximity. A great elevator scene works by leveraging both. These are some of our favorite intimate encounters set in these close quarters.\n\nThe Apartment (1960)\n\nC.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) has been displaced from his life. See, his bosses keep borrowing his bachelor pad for their affairs, and he lets them, hoping to get promoted up a few floors. So it\u2019s only fair that, in the office, he sometimes steals his own moment of human connection by chatting up Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), the elevator operator.\n\n\u201cThe characters you meet!\u201d she complains on the afternoon he\u2019s summoned up to the boss\u2019s office. \u201cSomething happens to men in elevators. It\u2019s the change of altitude. The blood rushes to their head or something.\u201d He responds by asking her to lunch. The doors open \u2014 time for his interview! \u2014 so he doesn\u2019t notice her non-answer of a smile. He smooths out his suit, and stammers, \u201cHow do I look?\u201d She steps out onto the floor, and in a little gesture of domestic intimacy, takes the flower from her lapel and pins it to him.\n\nOnly later do you notice the desperation beneath their pep. These are two lonely people who keep making the same bad deals (with middle managers, with men), measuring their lives in trade-offs that make them feel cheap. But this scene, with its lilting sense of possibility, helps you forget how sad \u201cThe Apartment\u201d ultimately is. You could live on this, the movie seems to say: a little stolen sweetness every day.\n\nThe Good Wife (Season 2, Episode 23, 2011)\n\nAfter 46 episodes and a crucial lost voice mail, two lawyers who have been repressing their mutual attraction wind up at a hotel bar. One asks: \u201cWhat if we were suddenly to have good timing, just for an hour? What would that look like?\u201d So Will (Josh Charles) and Alicia (Julianna Margulies), flush from a courtroom victory, finally do the imprudent thing: They try to find out.\n\nIt\u2019s not sexy \u2014 not at first. The hotel\u2019s booked up, with only the $7,800 presidential suite available. They\u2019re willing to pay, but then the elevator\u2019s completely full. They get on the next one, and some kid has pushed every single button on her way out. They smile. They\u2019re adults, and after all, they\u2019ve waited this long. But every time the doors open, it saps their momentum. It offers another chance to rethink, to sober up, to bail. \u201cMaybe . . . \u201d she ventures. He takes her hand. Their lips meet, and they push past the point of deniability.\n\nDrive (2011)\n\nThe unnamed Driver (Ryan Gosling) and the neighbor with whom he\u2019s in love, Irene (Carey Mulligan), enter their building\u2019s elevator. A stranger, seeming a little embarrassed to interrupt, stands there in a crumpled tan suit. The Driver catches sight of a gun in the stranger\u2019s pocket. He reaches behind him, moving Irene to the far corner of the space, carving out an even more private one. He pulls her in, and when they kiss, the slow motion and the watery soundtrack make it feel as if they\u2019ve ducked beneath the surface of reality.\n\nThe resurfacing is awful. The Driver twists, slamming the hit man\u2019s head against one wall, then another.\n\nBy the time the fight finishes, Irene has backed out of the elevator, staring. Technically, there\u2019s a fair amount of one-last-job action noir left after the doors close \u2014 but it\u2019s pretty forgettable, pure coda, after that meeting and separation.\n\nWorking Girl (1988)\n\nThis scene starts with someone not getting on board when he\u2019s supposed to.\n\nOutside the elevator, there\u2019s Tess (Melanie Griffith), a big-haired, whisper-voiced secretary. Inside stands her boss, M&A-executive Katherine (Sigourney Weaver), in her assertive red blazer, impatient to broker a business deal based on an idea she stole from Tess. Forced to decide between the two women \u2014 which one is the more appealing girlfriend, the better colleague? \u2014 Jack (Harrison Ford) stands strong and chooses the right one. More than that: He persuades the media boss (Philip Bosco) to leave Katherine behind and jump out just as the doors close, and gives Tess the space to make her pitch. Then he says the most romantic possible words both in Reagan-era Hollywood and for today\u2019s Girlboss striver: \u201cHear the lady out, sir. There\u2019s another elevator.\u201d\n\nNew Girl (Season 7, Episode 8, 2018)\n\nIt gets old after a while \u2014 the will-they-won\u2019t-they pendulum swing that keeps these network sitcoms running. The two best friends are never available or interested or paying attention at the same time. \u201cNew Girl\u201d almost didn\u2019t get the chance to properly end its central romantic arc: Network executives were going to cancel the show after Season 6, until but creator Liz Meriwether persuaded them to give her a few more episodes.\n\nThe series finale forces you to watch Nick (Jake Johnson) and Jess (Zooey Deschanel) reenact, in miniature, their six-year inability to get on the same level. He\u2019s up in the loft; she\u2019s locked outside. They furiously press the call buttons on their respective floors. She practically falls up the stairs to get to him; he catches a ride down. Seeing each other through the window, they splutter, \u201cStay right there!\u201d When they finally meet up in the elevator, they look like they can\u2019t believe it themselves, and you feel almost stupid with relief.\n\nYou\u2019ve Got Mail (1998)\n\nA stuck elevator triggers a different revelation in this movie, which is dated not so much by AOL CD-ROMs than by its almost adorable belief that Barnes & Noble is capitalism\u2019s apex predator.\n\nTom Hanks \u2014 his character has a name, but to find him likable, you have to register him as Tom Hanks \u2014 gets trapped with his girlfriend Patricia (Parker Posey), the doorman and a neighbor with a purse-size dog. The purgatory forces him to see what\u2019s worst in both Patricia and himself. Slumped on the floor, the group exchanges confessions about what they\u2019ll do if they \u201cever get out of here.\u201d (Sound familiar?) \u201cI\u2019m going to get my eyes lasered,\u201d she offers, glibly, then cuts off Tom Hanks when he\u2019s about to speak: \u201cWhere are my Tic Tacs?\u201d she shrieks.\n\nLooking at her, aghast, he stares down the prospect of a lifetime of this \u2014 of never revealing his earnest inner self. We never see her again. You don\u2019t last long in this genre if you\u2019re not game.\n\nYi Yi (2000)\n\nNJ (Nien-Jen Wu), a middle-aged father, is waiting to return upstairs to a family banquet. The elevator doors open, delivering Sherry (Su-Yun Ko), his high school sweetheart: \u201cIs it really you?\u201d What happens after that awkward, wistful reintroduction is even more remarkable: After they part, she doubles back, heels clicking, to yell at him for abandoning her all those years ago. The bell dings, and out bursts another old classmate, jovial, puncturing the moment. NJ barely says a word.\n\nThe star of the scene isn\u2019t one of its principals, but NJ\u2019s eight-year-old son, Yang Yang (Jonathan Chang). It\u2019s impossible to take your eyes off him, the movement of his buzz-cut head. It swivels, following the action, but only loosely. He shuffles his feet, plays with a Happy Meal toy. He doesn\u2019t say anything, and the camera doesn\u2019t catch his expression. The mystery of his perspective acts as a counterpoint to the melodrama, and makes the coincidence feels lived-in.\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy (Season 1, Episode 2, 2005)\n\n\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d that old warhorse, deploys elevators with no restraint across its 17 seasons, shoving the characters together and forcing them into the conversations they\u2019re dying to have. In the second episode, doctors Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) get in the elevator for their first private chat (and make-out session) after their one-night stand. We don\u2019t know these characters. They don\u2019t know each other. He still has a rakish edge. She does that thing that we\u2019ll learn is a tic of creator Shonda Rhimes, where a character can\u2019t say something once unless she says it three times: \u201cLook, I\u2019m drawing a line. A line is drawn. There is a big . . . line.\u201d He keeps almost, not quite, stepping on her sentences. Testing her balance.\n\nSo, so many more scenes will go down in elevators: a marriage proposal, a divorce or two, open-heart surgery, scads of awkward run-ins. This one sets the template.\n\nWho knew these were the ideal conditions for bravery? One person up front, the other standing just behind and to the side, eyes straight ahead. Until one turns.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RZJGAB55E5EV5JMU7AEOVXAS5A.jpg&w=1200"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9984153509140015}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "A great elevator scene works by leveraging both. \n\n Romance has two preconditions : timing and proximity."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "50b9748f-2e46-49b7-bc48-cc66809aca32", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "An innovative Georgetown lab looks to theater to quell political fires", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/georgetown-lab-empathy-theater/2021/02/11/ddd67580-6a44-11eb-9f80-3d7646ce1bc0_story.html", "description": "The nine-year-old Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics specializes in empathy.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 12:00:00 +0000", "body": "\u201cWhy do you go and storm the U.S. Capitol, or damage property or do any of those violent acts? You do it because you believe your voice is not heard,\u201d recited Nicole Albanese, a self-described liberal who graduated from Georgetown University in May. The words were those of Daniel Cochrane, a politically conservative alumnus of Patrick Henry College in Purcellville, Va., who, in turn, delivered two minutes of remarks by Albanese.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a big country, its identity has definitely shifted and changed,\u201d Cochrane said, as Albanese watched. \u201cSo, I think some people don\u2019t really have as clear, like, an idea of how it has changed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll evening, pairs from the two schools stepped into the roles of their partners \u2014 an exercise to get people with opposing views to listen to one another, using the tools of performance. The brainchild of Derek Goldman, chairman of the Georgetown Department of Performing Arts, the program is called \u201cIn Your Shoes.\u201d It is one facet of a unique Georgetown effort, the Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics \u2014 a blended unit of drama and diplomacy that seems especially well-suited for a nation divided against itself.\n\n\u201cAll of this work is what I\u2019ve been calling \u2018witness across difference,\u2019 \u201d said Goldman, who created the Lab in 2012 with Cynthia P. Schneider, a former U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands who is now a professor at Georgetown\u2019s School of Foreign Service. \u201cWhich is a way of saying that there is a particular power that performance has, to allow us to listen deeply, bear witness and ultimately empathize with each other.\u201d\n\nEmpathy, or rather the lack of it, has been a subject at the top of the American rhetorical menu over the past four years: It may even be argued that President Biden\u2019s election reflects voters\u2019 desire for a compassionate leader with a talent for listening. Empathy, too, seems in some manner to be at the heart of many of the Lab\u2019s interdisciplinary initiatives: to engage friends or strangers in dialogue through art and artistic practice \u2014 whether at the level of everyday discourse or between nations in forms of cultural diplomacy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEach of us from our own perspective has gone full-steam ahead with our real belief in the power of the arts broadly, and in particular live performance, to be a transformative experience,\u201d Schneider said of her collaboration with Goldman. \u201cAnd that live performance has the capacity to engage people around political issues in a very profound way. And really in a way nothing else can.\u201d\n\nThe Lab is project-oriented, rather than a classroom-based venture, co-sponsored by the theater program and the School of Foreign Service. \u201cWe\u2019ve been around for 100 years, and we were designed to be about cultural competency and empathy,\u201d observed Joel Hellman, dean of the School of Foreign Service. He added that it makes sense for his program to be part of the Lab, because \u201cwe\u2019re constantly trying to open minds.\u201d\n\nGoldman and Schneider\u2019s aspirations for the Lab have propelled it onto diverse paths. One of the Lab\u2019s long-term projects has been a play about the late Jan Karski, hero of the Polish resistance during World War II and later a Georgetown professor. An early version of \u201cRemember This: The Lesson of Jan Karski,\u201d starring David Strathairn and written by Goldman and former student Clark Young, was performed at the opening of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw in 2015. The play has been made into a movie with Strathairn and will be shown at film festivals later this year.\n\nOver the past several years, too, the Lab has been grappling with an ugly Georgetown legacy: the university\u2019s history of owning and selling enslaved people. \u201cHere I Am,\u201d a digital performance piece that will premiere in April, is the story of M\u00e9lisande Short-Colomb, a New Orleans woman and a descendant of two of the 314 enslaved people who in 1838 were sold by the Maryland Jesuits to raise money for the university. Short-Colomb, 67 \u2014 who four years ago became a Georgetown student after learning about her ancestors \u2014 performs the piece she created with actress-playwright \u00adNikkole Salter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was while taking one of Goldman\u2019s theater classes that \u201cHere I Am\u201d was conceived. \u201cThe class was not a performance-based class, but a memory-based class where we wrote about memories,\u201d Short-Colomb recalled in a Zoom interview. After she wrote about her own experiences, \u201cat the end of the semester, Derek said, \u2018I think you have something.\u2019 \u201d After a broader play about the group of enslaved people, who became known as the GU272, fell through, Short-Colomb said, she and Lab officials went to the university administration and got approval for her project.\n\nOne of the through lines with projects as different as \u201cRemember This\u201d and \u201cHere I Am\u201d is the notion of witnessing, and the moral authority that arises from personal testimony. \u201cWhat I have found over the years doing this is that people respond to it with a visceral, gut reaction,\u201d Strathairn said of the Karski show. \u201cIt\u2019s more of an empathic feeling that can nurture a different way of thinking \u2014 especially in a theater, when you have 300 people of all different ideologies, sharing an empathic moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Your Shoes\u201d goes deep into sharing, too. It\u2019s a collaboration between the Lab and Georgetown\u2019s Democracy and Governance program, sparked in 2018 by program director Daniel Brumberg\u2019s interest in students exploring political polarization. As the concept for the \u201cIn Your Shoes\u201d meetups took shape, Brumberg contacted Cory Grewell, a professor of literature and drama club adviser at Patrick Henry, a 40-minute drive from Georgetown. Its homepage notes that the college \u201cexists to glorify God by challenging the unacceptable status quo in higher education.\u201d\n\nGrewell said he immediately recognized the value in Goldman\u2019s methodology: what Brumberg describes academically as \u201cfacilitated dialogue.\u201d The students may not be walking a mile in one another\u2019s shoes, but they take several major strides in them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not simply bringing people from different ideological camps to talk,\u201d Grewell said. \u201cYou really have to imagine what makes this other person tick, their fears, their desires.\u201d\n\nAnd as Brumberg suggested, a little showbiz in academia can\u2019t hurt: \u201cI guess Derek would say there\u2019s an actor in all of us.\u201d\n\nFor the Lab\u2019s \u201cIn Your Shoes\u201d Zoom session last month, participants from earlier gatherings reunited, and were given a general \u201cprompt\u201d for their discussions. \u201cWe said, \u2018Focus the conversation on your experience around January 6 and since then, and what they surfaced for you,\u2019 \u201d Goldman recalled. Before the coronavirus pandemic imposed restrictions on physical contact, the Patrick Henry and Georgetown students gathered in person, and over the course of the program, they interacted with different partners.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s separate from finding common ground, or \u2018Let\u2019s see what we can agree on\u2019 type of rhetoric,\u201d said Ijeoma Njaka, a Brown University graduate who works part time as the Lab\u2019s inclusive pedagogy specialist. \u201cThere are students on both campuses who were interested in this project because they thought they were living in a bubble.\u201d\n\nOne of the goals of \u201cIn Your Shoes\u201d is to encourage participants to capture not only the words of the other person, but also some of their mannerisms \u2014 a gentle acknowledgment of how completely they are being observed and heard. \u201cTo my delight, the approach was not about diminishing differences, it\u2019s about encouraging differences,\u201d said Cochrane, who graduated from Patrick Henry in 2019 with a degree in political theory and now works on legal and policy issues in the D.C. area.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCochrane said he was concerned that the exchanges might devolve into arguments about then-President Donald Trump.

The Nanjing-born D.C. resident works in many media, but her most distinctive creations are made of paint. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re painted, exactly. Wu layers assorted colors of house paint and lets the sandwiched, multihued pigment dry. Then she cuts it into morsels to be arranged into abstract mosaics on wood panels. (A video on her website demonstrates the process.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs a first-generation American, Wu followed closely Donald Trump\u2019s comments on immigration. The ex-president\u2019s words provide the titles for such sculpture-paintings as \u201c90% of the Drugs,\u201d but they\u2019re otherwise unpolitical. That picture consists of hole-punched circles of paint clustered tightly on a red backdrop that is visible at the bottom. Other pieces feature fabric-like motifs that recall those of batik or, well, quilts. The geometric designs are executed with varying degrees of control and uniformity. Meticulous in construction, Wu\u2019s patterns nonetheless slip, slide and oscillate \u2014 much like images made by simply brushing paint onto a surface.\n\nSherry Trachtman and Jenny Wu: Material Reality Through Feb. 27 at Fred Schnider Gallery, 888 N. Quincy St., Arlington. Open by appointment.\n\nCounterCurrent\n\nAbout as sprawling and diverse a show as the compact Gallery B can contain, \u201cCounterCurrent\u201d encompasses painting, sculpture, drawing and photography as well as decorative crafts. Organized by the local but globally focused Art4Us Artists cooperative, \u201cCounterCurrent\u201d features work by four principals of that group \u2014 Nana Bagdavadze, Katty Biglari, Antonella Manganelli and Grazia Montalto. Their art is supplemented, and sometimes contrasted, by pieces from an international competition juried by Manganelli and Montalto.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMuch of the highlighted artists\u2019 work is autobiographical, although often indirectly. Bagdavadze, originally from the Georgia that doesn\u2019t border Florida, makes paintings and hand-finished prints of DNA double helixes that are inspired by having been a bone-marrow donor for her sister. Rather than dryly scientific, the pictures are vivid and sensuous, depicting spirals of glossy orbs that glisten like pearls or caviar.\n\nBiglari, who spent much of her childhood in Paris with her Iranian-emigre family, filled a scroll with heartfelt drawings of the French capital; the paper is coiled on rollers inside a box that frames each scene in succession. Montalto recalls the Naples of her youth with intricate paintings that often include a volcano. Her style, which recalls both Art Nouveau and 1960s psychedelia, bends Eastward for one picture that illustrates the legend of a koi (an ornamental carp) that becomes a dragon.\n\nIn a serendipitous link, a koi is the only representational element in a painting by Alessandra Ricci, whose mixed-media compositions contrast the materiality of gold leaf with abstract blooms of watery pigment at their centers. The Italy-bred artist also contributed a striking sculptural painting divided by lengths of string that both burrow into the thick pigment and protrude from it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSculptors Davide Prete and Warren Chambers offer eloquent sculptures that share some attributes yet are fundamentally different. Prete\u2019s 3-D-printed monolith of looping tendrils is both airy and imposing, with a metallic sheen derived from infused aluminum powder. Chambers\u2019s creation is actually metallic, made from a single sheet of lead that is punctuated by four segments \u2014 each one wider than the one to its left \u2014 hand-razored into bundles of twisted ribbons. (The cutting technique must be something like Wu\u2019s.) The artist can\u2019t turn lead into gold, but making the hard gray substance appear soft and lacy is almost as impressive.\n\nCounterCurrent Through Feb. 26 at Gallery B, 7700 Wisconsin Ave., #E, Bethesda.\n\nRed\n\nAs a group-show theme, \u201cRed\u201d may seem foolproof, but it entails a risk. While the prints and photographs in the Washington Printmakers Gallery exhibition are energized by the hot hue, not every artist can render fresh such familiar embodiments of redness as a rose, a firetruck or a pair of lips.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose commonplaces are all given pleasing twists. Sandra Chen Weinstein, who also supplies a voluptuous close-up of a red-fleshed peach, photographs multiple sets of stylized lips projected on a building. Clara Young Kim places her camera tightly to reveal that a fire engine is as battered as it is shiny. Printmaker Lila Oliver Asher\u2019s rose is a bright but dainty highlight, held by a gray silhouette of a woman.\n\nSally Canzoneri\u2019s photo of a patched-together wooden structure is even less red than Asher\u2019s print, since the building\u2019s coat of scarlet paint has almost entirely vanished. A Bob Burgess photo depicts some sort of facade that is redder and more battered than Kim\u2019s firetruck, and the picture is so intimately framed that its subjects become just color and texture.\n\nRed is the color of revolution, linocut artist Norman Strike proclaims with a to-the-barricades gun-control poster. But ink, paper and an engraving tool can also yield tricky results, as Nina Muys and Rosemary Cooley demonstrate.

The question of belonging is central to the immigrant experience; the children of immigrants often refer to feeling caught between two worlds, a phrase rooted in truth but ubiquitous enough to American media for it to have become a trope. There is an inherent loneliness to such an existence, even with its burgeoning population. Yeun, whose family left Seoul in 1988, refers to the community as \u201cgap people.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe gap is where Yeun spent his formative years as a Korean American kid in Troy, Mich. It\u2019s where he currently resides as one of the most recognizable Asian faces in a White-dominated industry, thanks to an eclectic film career and years spent fighting zombies on \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cMinari,\u201d out Friday, frames that existence differently: What if it isn\u2019t about feeling torn between two disparate lives, but about bringing them together to forge a new, fulfilling one?\n\nBased on director Lee Isaac Chung\u2019s childhood, the film picks up with the family\u2019s Reagan-era move from California to a plot of land in Arkansas, where patriarch Jacob (Yeun) hopes to start a farming business. His ambition drives the story, overlapping with his efforts to quell concerns his wife, Monica (Yeri Han), has about finding a sense of community in their isolated town.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s a novelty to \u201cMinari\u201d in how gently it incorporates cultural differences that could so easily have played out melodramatically. Chung highlights the ties Jacob and Monica\u2019s children, Anne (Noel Cho) and David (Alan Kim), maintain to their heritage in small, charming ways; David sips the herbal remedy Monica\u2019s mother (Yuh-Jung Youn) gives him to improve his health, and she, in turn, drinks the Mountain Dew that Anne earnestly describes as \u201cwater from the mountains.\u201d\n\nThe loneliness that accompanies displacement still plays a role here, adding a layer of desperation to Jacob\u2019s farming efforts. But the character\u2019s emotional journey hits universal notes, a dynamic Yeun says he and Chung sustained by ensuring the character felt \u201chonest and truthful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t seeking to define this family\u2019s existence through their oppression by the majority, but rather the confidence to speak from their own point of view, intrinsically,\u201d Yeun says. \u201cTheir existence is valid, and they can just be. In some ways, what that is, is just an exercise in humanity.\u201d\n\nAfter emigrating from Seoul to Regina, Saskatchewan, the Yeun family moved to Taylor, Mich., a working-class suburb southwest of Detroit. By the time Steven was in high school, they had moved to a townhouse in Troy, on the more affluent side of town.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe American heartland continues to be underrepresented in most forms of media, a reality on full display in the months surrounding each presidential election. Yeun, who brought his Midwestern sensibility to the role, notes the false impressions outsiders often have of non-coastal regions: \"Public discourse has been flattened these days. It\u2019s so politicized.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the larger world misunderstands places like that and doesn\u2019t give them the credit they\u2019re due for how they uphold certain beautiful dynamics in this country, and just as people and humans,\u201d Yeun says. \u201cThere\u2019s just something there, and I\u2019ve been finding myself nostalgic for that, but also carrying both [feelings] \u2026 You can be hurt and love a place at the same time.\u201d\n\nHurt is almost inevitable for a person of color growing up in a majority-White area, whether inflicted with or without intention. The family in \u201cMinari\u201d similarly sticks out when they visit a church in town, where Anne is asked about the Korean language by a White child relying on stereotypical garble. The film acknowledges this wrong, but never antagonizes the child. David later on befriends another young boy who, at first meeting, stares at him for looking different.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe film is honest, Yeun says. These were the realities of that era. It further upends expectations with Paul (Will Patton), a Christian fundamentalist who works with Jacob on the farm. He speaks in tongues and carries a giant cross to town each Sunday, leading a vastly different lifestyle than Jacob would choose for his family. But the two men form a bond. As a storyteller, Yeun says he is drawn to those who are \u201cunseen,\u201d and extends the notion of life in the gap to include the character.\n\nFor all the value of that gap framing, there is weight to the alternative: Sometimes it isn\u2019t a chasm, but a cultural intersection. Immigration is inherently traumatic, Yeun says, recalling the shock of being dropped off at kindergarten in a brand-new country when he couldn\u2019t yet speak the language. But over time, he managed to find compatibilities between his two cultures.\n\nThere is something distinctly Korean about understanding yourself in concordance with one another, he continues, speaking to his experience: \u201cAnd I feel like that is something the Midwest grapples with, too, this collectiveness that inhabits our being. We don\u2019t really try to stick out too hard in the Midwest, either. It\u2019s a very collective, working-class, union-type of life.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinated to be molded by two separate cultures that kind of feel the same way.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cMinari,\u201d Jacob\u2019s unlikely friendship with Paul hints at a broader, neighborly sense of community. But the collectivist sentiment plays out on a familial scale. In response to Monica\u2019s growing disillusionment with their new life, Jacob asks her in Korean, \u201cRemember what we said when we got married? That we\u2019d move to America and save each other?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such a unique perspective of immigrants from the Midwest,\u201d Yeun adds of his inspiration for the character. \u201cI think [the film] speaks to the truth of the American experience in a way that people haven\u2019t perhaps seen as much. And on top of that, it also speaks to this regional truth that a lot of times people don\u2019t see as much. And so I was happy to service both.\u201d\n\nWhile drawn to the honesty of \u201cMinari,\u201d Yeun hesitated to play a Korean father. Barely older than a toddler when his family left Seoul, the actor worried about his ability to do Jacob justice. Would he get the language right? His inflection? His mannerisms?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAll that was work to realize that I was seeing my own parents through a prism of my own gaze that wasn\u2019t truthful to their own humanity,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile I didn\u2019t project my own father onto the character of Jacob, what was really scary and painful but also so beautiful was in some ways realizing that I am my father, and I am an extension of him and his will and his desires. His spirit. I didn\u2019t need to perform a caricature.\u201d\n\nYeun has worked to avoid the stereotypical \u201cWhite gaze\u201d roles that so often serve as a launchpad for Asian American actors facing a dearth of opportunity. After graduating from Kalamazoo College, he cut his teeth at Second City in Chicago and eventually moved to Los Angeles.\n\nWithin six months, he booked \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt can seem like things fell into place for Yeun, who says he would\u2019ve accepted almost any role at the time. He just happened to hitch his wagon to a soon-to-be-hit AMC series. But as the actor later told Vulture, it seemed \u201cpeople didn\u2019t know what to do with Glenn,\u201d whose controversial, brutal death kicked off the seventh season in 2016: \u201cI didn\u2019t think of it as racism, where it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, this is racist,'\u201d Yeun continued in the magazine interview. \u201cI caught it in a way of, \u2018Oh, this is how we\u2019re viewed all the time\u2019 \u2014 as part of some glob, some amorphous, nonindividualistic collective.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLeaving the show allowed Yeun to amass a diverse assortment of credits, returning to comedy in series like \u201cTuca and Bertie\u201d and fellow Michigander Tim Robinson\u2019s \u201cI Think You Should Leave,\u201d and exploring dramatic tone with Bong Joon-ho\u2019s \u201cOkja\u201d and Boots Riley\u2019s \u201cSorry to Bother You.\u201d\n\nBong wrote the character K specifically for Yeun, knowing his specific Korean American upbringing would help him breathe life into a man expected to serve as a bridge between the Americans in the Animal Liberation Front and the Koreans surrounding their efforts in Seoul. Yeun notes that K fails in his efforts to service both groups, a harsh truth the actor \u201cneeded to expose for myself to say, hey, you know that feeling of not fitting in anywhere? I want you to live it up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe later returned to Korea to shoot Lee Chang-dong\u2019s 2018 psychological thriller \u201cBurning,\u201d in which he plays a Korean national who is \u201cso beyond the limits of society that he just gets to be free.\u201d Ben is a charming enigma, oozing confidence. Given the complexity of his personal relationship to Korea, Yeun says he found it liberating to \u201cbe outside of the American gaze of what an Asian person is, and to be serviced in a role that was at the top of its own power.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMinari\u201d returns to that American gaze, but challenges its rigid views. Yeun was drawn to how the film didn\u2019t seek to define itself as any one thing, and lacked a barrier to entry.\n\n\u201cStories from communities that are usually underserviced, you want to hold them tight so nobody takes them from you,\u201d Yeun says. \u201cThere was something really cool about letting it go and opening it up and not saying, \u2018This is only accessible by us,' but rather it\u2019s open to everyone because this is about people. This is about humans living a life. It actually ended up making me see myself a little bit clearer and fuller.\u201d\n\nClarification: An earlier version of this article included ambiguous geographic references to Arkansas and the Midwest.

Whereas the first movie freshened up genre tropes \u2014 the plot centered on bookworm Lara Jean Covey (Condor) pretending to date sensitive lax bro Peter Kavinsky (Centineo) for mutual gain \u2014 the third feels stale.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt picks up with the three Covey daughters honoring their late mother\u2019s memory by visiting South Korea over spring break with their father (John Corbett) and his soon-to-be fiancee (Sarayu Blue), whose romance is one of few aspects from the second movie to remain relevant. Awaiting Lara Jean at home are the stresses of college acceptance season as well as her boyfriend, Peter, with whom she plans to attend Stanford. The catch, of course, is that she doesn\u2019t actually get in \u2014 and while on a class trip across the country, she falls deeply in love with New York University instead.\n\nWill their relationship survive the distance? Should they just break up now and get it over with? Both are real questions high-schoolers face at this point in their lives, but that doesn\u2019t amount to engaging conflict here thanks to a dull screenplay. Though Condor and Centineo bring their best assets to the table \u2014 sincerity and charm, respectively \u2014 the film doesn\u2019t give them much to do. (It does try to jam in a \u201cSpectacular Now\u201d-lite reconciliation story line between Peter and his father, which feels a bit out of the blue.)\n\nThe franchise traded hands after the \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before,\u201d with cinematographer Michael Fimognari grabbing the directing reins from Susan Johnson for the latter two films. The tonal shift is palpable, an upbeat rom-com swapped for movies going through the motions. \u201cP.S. I Love You\u201d and \u201cAlways and Forever\u201d are perfectly inoffensive Netflix rom-coms \u2014 and yes, the opposite sort exists \u2014 but, unfortunately for fans who had high hopes for them, that\u2019s all the films wind up being.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRegardless of whether Lara Jean and Peter have outgrown each other, it seems their audience (and the actors, given the more dynamic roles coming their way) have outgrown them.

He is nominated in two categories for this year\u2019s Grammys, which will be awarded next month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring the 1960s, Mr. Corea worked alongside such traditional jazz greats as Stan Getz, Woody Herman, Freddie Hubbard and Sarah Vaughan before exploring the more modern vistas of electronic music. When Davis, a trumpeter and mercurial force in jazz since the 1940s, started his rock-oriented \u201celectric\u201d band in the late 1960s, Mr. Corea joined as keyboardist and adapted to the new sound, experimenting with the Fender Rhodes piano and other electronic keyboard instruments. He performed on Davis\u2019s groundbreaking 1970 album \u201cBitches Brew\u201d and on other Davis electric outings, including \u201cFilles de Kilimanjaro\u201d and \u201cIn a Silent Way.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe inspired musicians to think for themselves,\u201d Mr. Corea said of Davis in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times. \u201cSometimes he\u2019d walk up to me and put his mouth next to my ear and whisper, \u2018Chick, you\u2019re nuts.\u2019 But he never fired us so he couldn\u2019t have hated it all that badly.\u201d\n\nMr. Corea extended that freedom of expression into his own musical ensembles. Throughout his career, he often had three or four working groups going at a time, jumping from electronic music to straight-ahead jazz duets and trios and small groups. He even performed piano concertos by Mozart and other classical composers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeginning in 1966, with his debut album \u201cTones for Joan\u2019s Bones,\u201d Mr. Corea recorded more than 100 albums and wrote hundreds of musical works, ranging from chamber music and symphonic compositions to several tunes that have become modern jazz standards, including \u201cSpain,\u201d \u201cLa Fiesta\u201d and \u201cArmando\u2019s Rhumba.\u201d\n\nBy 1972, Mr. Corea had left Davis to form Return to Forever, which emerged as one of the most popular and influential jazz fusion groups of the decade. At different times, the musicians included bassist Stanley Clarke, drummer Lenny White, guitarist Al Di Meola and singer Flora Purim, leading to a distinctive blend of rock, jazz and Brazilian music. The group\u2019s 1975 recording, \u201cNo Mystery,\u201d won Mr. Corea his first Grammy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d see young people at rock concerts standing to listen rather than sitting politely,\u201d Mr. Corea told jazz writer Marc Myers in a 2011 online interview, explaining his journey into electronic music. \u201cIt was a different vibe and more my generation. It got me interested in communicating that way. People were standing because they were emotionally caught up in what they were hearing. I related to that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, Mr. Corea never abandoned his earlier roots in straight-ahead jazz. While working on his electronic projects, which were sometimes scorned by skeptical jazz critics, he continued to perform on the standard acoustic piano, which he called \u201cthe most gorgeous and sophisticated percussion instrument ever conceived.\u201d\n\nHe released three albums of solo piano improvisations in the 1970s and began making intimate duet recordings with vibrapharpist Gary Burton, in a musical partnership that lasted decades. Two of Mr. Corea\u2019s recordings from the mid-1970s, \u201cThe Leprechaun\u201d and the double album \u201cMy Spanish Heart,\u201d expanded his popularity after Return to Forever dissolved in 1976.\n\nIn 1978, Mr. Corea joined forces with Herbie Hancock, another pianist who had worked with Davis and later became celebrated for his forays into electronic fusion. In a worldwide tour, they performed on acoustic grand pianos in programs that ranged from original compositions to tunes by George Gershwin and classical composer Bela Bartok.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThrough the 1980s, Mr. Corea remained a musical chameleon, adapting to almost any musical setting with ease. He formed a new group, called the Elektric Band, that offered a \u201cscintillating blend that draws almost equally from the Latin, classical, bop and jazz-rock fusion stylings,\u201d wrote San Diego Union-Tribune writer George Varga.\n\nSoon afterward, Mr. Corea formed the \u201cAkoustic Band\u201d with his Elektric Band rhythm mates \u2014 bassist John Patitucci and drummer Dave Weckl \u2014 to perform standard, unplugged jazz fare.\n\nIn 1984, he recorded a solo piano album called \u201cChildren\u2019s Songs,\u201d while also composing a work of chamber music, \u201cLyric Suite for Sextet.\u201d For all his musical adventures, Mr. Corea\u2019s favorite format was the traditional jazz trio.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a classic, put together for ways that I like to play,\u201d he told The Washington Post in 2006. \u201cIt\u2019s a small enough group that a lot of intimacy can go on during the performance, and a large enough group that you can make a lot of sound and do a lot of different things.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nArmando Anthony Corea was born June 12, 1941, in Chelsea, Mass. His mother was a homemaker, his father a Dixieland trumpeter who introduced him to music at an early age.\n\nMr. Corea, whose nickname evolved from an aunt who called him \u201cCheeky,\u201d began to study the piano at age 4. When he was about 16, he had his first major professional job, working for a week in Boston with Cab Calloway, a singer and showman who had been popular in the 1930s.\n\nAD\n\nAfter brief studies at Columbia University and the Juilliard School in New York, Mr. Corea embarked on a career in jazz, working early on with percussionists Mongo Santamaria and Willie Bobo, from whom he developed an abiding interest in the complex rhythms of Cuban and Latin American music.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always heard music, jazz especially, through the drums more than the piano,\u201d he said in 2001. \u201cI hear how the rhythm moves and how the motion goes, and how it dances, and what the groove feels like and the touch of it, before anything else happens.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe later had stints with Getz, Herbie Mann and Vaughan, while developing a \u201cmainstream jazz approach,\u201d in the words of jazz historian Ted Gioia, that \u201cboasted a clean, sharply articulated piano sound, a mix of modal and impressionist harmonies, and a driving on-to-of-the-beat rhythmic feel.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn 1968, Mr. Corea joined the Church of Scientology, which he credited with unlocking his creative impulses. He was one of the controversial church\u2019s best-known members and eventually settled near its headquarters in Clearwater, Fla.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of more than 40 years, singer and composer Gayle Moran; two children from an earlier marriage; and several grandchildren.\n\nMr. Corea toured constantly overseas and across North America. He observed his 60th and 70th birthdays at New York\u2019s Blue Note jazz club, he performed in multiple ensembles during almost monthlong engagements. He was honored as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 2006. His most recent album, \u201cChick Corea: Plays\u201d (2020) contains a typically eclectic collection of tunes, including works by Mozart, Scarlatti, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Thelonious Monk and Mr. Corea himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done two main things for years and years,\u201d he told the San Diego Union-Tribune in 2001. \u201cFirst, I follow my heart and imagination.

But the show has maintained its relevance, in the fall winning the Emmy for outstanding variety talk series for a fifth straight year. Oliver, who ended his seventh season in November by \u201cblowing up\u201d 2020, returns with a new season Sunday. The Washington Post talked with him by Zoom. (The conversation has been lightly edited for brevity.)\n\nSo it\u2019s been a quiet few months since you last had a show.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRun of the mill, really.\n\nWhat did you think as you were watching the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6? Besides \u201cI wish I was on the air right now.\u201d\n\nIt was kind of the opposite of that, actually. I was really glad not to be on the air. Because sometimes it's nice not to have to fiddle while Rome burns.\n\nWhat did cross your mind?\n\nThe initial reactions along the lines of \u201cthis just seems unimaginable.\u201d Which just seems \u2026 not accurate. It\u2019s not just actively imaginable \u2014 it was literally predictable. \u201cIt\u2019s unimaginable\u201d comes from a place of such naive, willfully blind comfort. It\u2019s dangerous to think \u201cthis could not happen here\u201d when we all watched in real time the buildup to exactly that.\n\nAD\n\nAre we equally naive then in your view to think we\u2019re out of the woods now [in terms of unrest]?\n\nOf course. The dangerous thing is the optimistic reaction Biden tends to have a lot, which is \u201cthis is not who were are.\u201d You understand why he says that because it makes people feel better. But it probably makes them feel a little too much better. Because the tenth time you say \u201cthis is not who we are\u201d it might be a little bit who we actually are.\n\nAD\n\nSome suggest with Trump out of office a time of disquiet has passed. Yet in many ways it feels like it\u2019s just beginning \u2014 the contretemps over Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s comments recently, for example.\n\nThere\u2019s going to be a long tail to that process and I think it will become clearer and clearer the extent to which he [Trump] has set a new course for the Republican Party. It\u2019s not just Marjorie Taylor Greene \u2014 there\u2019s plenty of other people with very dangerous views. But the idea that we\u2019re closing a chapter of American history \u2014 that\u2019s just not how history works. Those chapters tend not to exist in [expletive] isolation.\n\nWhat\u2019s going to be your approach on Trump now \u2014 do you want the show to lean in to anything he does? Or is it your belief that will be giving him what he wants?\n\nAD\n\nThat was always the internal calculation you made with him as president. He\u2019s a guy who wants attention more than anything else. So it\u2019s working out \u201cwhen is it irresponsible to give him that attention\u201d and \u201cwhen is it actively irresponsible to ignore him.\u201d We managed to keep the body of our show intact from him most of the time. We spend weeks on our main story. So for us there were key calculations in \u201cdo we still do what we\u2019re planning to do or do we respond to what he\u2019s just done?\u201d The majority of time was let\u2019s keep going. There were definitely moments when it was \u201cno, we\u2019re going to throw that show out.\u201d A really visceral example was his reaction to Jamal Khashoggi being murdered. It felt like there was nothing else that week.\n\nAD\n\nI think the calculation will be similar when he\u2019s out of office. When is it a good idea to ignore him? Which will be a lot of the time. And when would it be reckless not to address what just happened. But I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll be a significantly diminished figure \u2014 [I hope] that both as a human being and as someone who writes comedy.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, I asked Steve Bodow, your former colleague at \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d about what it would mean for late-night comedians not to have Trump in office, and he said they\u2019d not only be \u201cpolitically and patriotically happier, but they\u2019ll be comedically happier.\u201d The idea that late-night wants what Trump provides, he says, is a myth.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s a complete myth and it\u2019s kind of genuinely insulting. [Laughs] Wow, how little do you think of me? Because partly it comes from \u201coh, it must\u2019ve written itself.\u201d Really? You [expletive] think that? You try injecting poison into your body every week and get a joke out the other side that Twitter hasn\u2019t already come up with. The happiest I was at the end of last year was we finished our final show and started working on our new list of shows. And it was just great to be able to think about wonky stories.\n\nAD\n\nTrump so much wanted to make every story about him. He\u2019s often not the key part of every story; the systemic problems underneath were there before him and will remain after him. That gets to your point \u2014 it\u2019s the danger of thinking we closed that chapter. Not really.\n\nWhat might some of those problems and wonky stories be?\n\nAD\n\nThe long gestating problems this virus has shone a spotlight on that have been ignored for a long time. Human history has shown we\u2019re pretty adept at choosing to forget about them again as soon as it\u2019s convenient. So I think the virus will be an interesting hook into some interesting stories this year.\n\nBecause it touches on everything \u2014 health care, racial inequity, class inequity.\n\nAnd even our division. What a virus needs more than anything else is a collective effort, and at the best of times America has an individualistic side, which is not particularly suited to that. And right now it\u2019s, of course, even worse because it\u2019s being politicized. The virus touches every side of human life and has exposed all the weaknesses of American society.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFrom an entertainment-consumption standpoint, what\u2019s something you think will be very different at the end of this? Or are we going to go back to exactly how things were?\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to project, because to go back a year is to go back to a different world. I haven\u2019t seen my staff in nearly a year. I haven\u2019t heard human laughter since mid-March. The thing I can\u2019t imagine is being in front of an audience. I can\u2019t imagine how that\u2019s going to feel. But it\u2019s so hard to project what the other side of this will look like. Especially because systemically and politically, a return to normal is not what we should be aiming for.\n\nYou blew up 2020 in your last episode in November. Are you ready to blow up 2021 yet?

He plays Assane Diop, the son of an emigrant from Senegal who settled in France. Inspired by the century-old stories of Lupin\u2019s capers and disguises, Diop seeks revenge for the false imprisonment and suicide of his father. (In the world of TV, this is not a laughable idea.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo everyone\u2019s surprise, this quintessentially French series, with its debut episode shot inside the Louvre, has become a top-10 hit on Netflix. Yet what better escape from pandemic and impeachment than lighthearted capers through the drawing rooms and across the rooftops of Paris? Sy is the kind of charismatic actor viewers would follow anywhere. His grin could charm the diamonds off a dowager \u2014 and does.\n\nBravado has always been Lupin\u2019s trademark. The entire production is as stylish and choreographed and silly as the pre-credits teaser in a James Bond movie. And it\u2019s beautiful. Cinematographers Christophe Nuyen and Martial Schmeltz fill every episode with rich color and texture: moody nighttime boulevards, sparkling jewels, noir shadows. Even a hoodie looks luxurious in this light.\n\nThe acting is as good as the design. You will recognize Diop\u2019s disaffected wife as Ludivine Sagnier of \u201cSwimming Pool\u201d and \u201cThe New Pope.\u201d She makes the most of her stereotypical role as a rogue\u2019s long-suffering romantic interest.\n\nIn 1905, a magazine editor asked Maurice Leblanc to contribute a story of adventure along the lines of Sherlock Holmes. Leblanc later claimed that he sat down without an idea in his head and found Ars\u00e8ne Lupin on the page, a character who united the traditions of gentleman rogue and heroic adventurer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe debut story proved instantly popular. The first collection appeared in 1906, and many more followed, along with antic novels that make Captain Nemo look lazy \u2014 outrageous adventures, melodramatic, literate, sparkling with amusing banter. When Lupin explains that he is posing as an ex-cabinet minister, he adds, \u201cI had to select a rather overstocked profession, so as not to attract attention.\u201d In several stories, Leblanc borrowed Holmes for skirmishes with Lupin, who outwits the great detective at every turn \u2014 and even steals his watch.\n\nHis frequent laugh is the triumphant guffaw of Robin Hood once more defying the Sheriff of Nottingham. \u201cBy Jove, I wouldn\u2019t sell this moment for a fortune!\u201d he exclaims when anyone else might simply abandon the illicit (and difficult) task at hand. \u201cWho dares pretend that life is monotonous?\u201d\n\nLupin tales sold prodigiously and inspired plays and then movies, beginning with a silent one in 1917. The saga has never been out of print in France, where Lupin has even appeared on a stamp. Jean-Paul Sartre once confessed of his youthful reading, \u201cI adored the Cyrano of the underworld, Ars\u00e8ne Lupin.\u201d Lupin remains popular enough to have been resurrected for a late 20th-century series written by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, authors of the novels behind such films as \u201cLes Diaboliques\u201d and Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cVertigo.\u201d The long-running Japanese anime series \u201cLupin III\u201d features Lupin\u2019s grandson.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo show us just how filthy rich the villain is, the new Netflix series houses him in Paris\u2019s grand Mus\u00e9e Nissim de Camondo (a museum of decorative arts) \u2014 surfaces glittering with gold in the kind of insecure Sun King bluster that risks being renamed Trump Modern. Capitalists are filmdom\u2019s new Russian spies, heartless and often sporting a bad haircut.\n\nBut this attitude was present in the Lupin stories a century ago. Pittsburgh moguls were building castles out of the lives of coal miners and the latest London millionaire might have been cracking the whip a month before over diamond sifters in Kimberley, South Africa. The turn of the century introduced many glib rogues. Readers gradually discover that Grant Allen\u2019s thief Colonel Clay is waging a war against Gilded Age hubris as much as replenishing his own coffers.\n\nFrederick Irving Anderson\u2019s jewel thief Sophie Lang was so popular that she was incarnated in three 1930s movies before the Hays Office declared that no criminals would profit from their crimes on wholesome American screens. Even Cary Grant\u2019s thief from 1955 emerged from \u201cretirement\u201d only to clear his name. Five years later, the original Rat Pack \u201cOcean\u2019s Eleven\u201d dodged censors by depriving the crooks of their ill-gotten gains through a twist of fate. As late as 1968, Robert Wagner\u2019s suave Alexander Mundy in the TV series \u201cIt Takes a Thief\u201d could practice his illicit craft only for the U.S. government.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTime flies. By the era of \u201cOcean\u2019s Eight,\u201d in 2018, the all-female team of crooks make robbing the Metropolitan Museum of Art look as innocent and profitable as selling Girl Scout cookies. Omar Sy\u2019s new character is right on time.\n\nBack in 1913, the English critic Charles Henry Meltzer asked Leblanc, \u201cDo you not think you have done some harm by making a hero of a man like Ars\u00e8ne Lupin?\u201d\n\nHe replied, \u201cNo, I think my conscience is at least as nice as most.\u201d Leblanc admitted that at first he didn\u2019t want his son Claude to read his books. \u201cSince then, however,\u201d said the creator of the thief who picked the pocket of Sherlock Holmes, \u201cI have changed my mind.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FH73WCTLCMI6XJTO4JYEN2PITA.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9998341798782349}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "AD \n\n AD \n\n To everyone \u2019s surprise , this quintessentially French series , with its debut episode shot inside the Louvre , has become a top-10 hit on Netflix.

Gonzaga (19-0) and Houston (17-2) will get there this weekend. Alabama (16-5), Ohio State (16-4) and Iowa (14-6) are already there. Illinois (13-5) isn\u2019t far off.\n\nBut both Michigan (13-1) and Villanova (13-2) had long virus-related pauses, and Baylor (17-0) is stuck in one now. How much will the number of data points matter? If Michigan or Villanova finds itself on the top line (and the Wolverines in particular have a solid claim to a No. 1 seed), the committee will have provided an answer.\n\nAD\n\nValue of road/neutral victories: A road game in 2020-21 isn\u2019t the same as in other years. Yes, there are plane rides and hotel stays and some extra hoops to jump through. But with fans limited (if not entirely absent) from on-campus arenas, home-court advantage isn\u2019t what it usually is.\n\nAD\n\nSo will road success be rewarded nearly as much? Hard to say, but there might not be much to read into from the committee\u2019s reveal. No one needs to know Ohio State\u2019s record outside Columbus (7-3) to realize the Buckeyes are good. As in most years, teams like those will be treated well, anyway.\n\nThe more intriguing teams are ones closer to the edge of the field like Saint Louis (9-3 overall but 0-2 on the road) and Minnesota (13-7 overall but 0-6 on the road), programs with some accomplishments but none outside their home gyms. Neither is going to pop up in Saturday\u2019s reveal, but both could use a hint on whether road success matters as much as usual this year.\n\nAD\n\nIs there an unusual trend in the metrics? The NET (and the RPI before it) are merely sorting tools, so the better idea here is to compare things like Quadrant 1 performance or lack of Quadrant 3 and 4 losses. Rest assured, there will be an attempt to find a trend, though that doesn\u2019t mean it will hold up a month from now.\n\nAD\n\nOne team to watch for here is Missouri (13-4), which is 5-3 in Quadrant 1 games; only Ohio State, Gonzaga and Baylor have more. And while the Tigers have no truly questionable losses, they\u2019re just 34th in the NET.\n\nIs there a surprise team included? Just like in mid-March in most seasons, it\u2019s not hard to scribble down at least a dozen teams certain to be allocated a No. 4 seed or better. A bunch of teams already mentioned, along with the likes of Tennessee and Virginia will probably be in the conversation as well.\n\nHow is the surplus of quality non-Baylor Big 12 teams, such as Oklahoma, Texas, Texas Tech and West Virginia treated? Or metrics darling Colorado (11th on KenPom.com, 12th in the NET entering Friday)? Or, more realistically, Pac-12 leader Southern California (16-3)?\n\nAD\n\nThere won\u2019t be tea leaves to read on every front. For instance, the willingness of the committee to select a .500 (or worse) team as an at-large won\u2019t be determined until next month. Yet there should be something to take away from Saturday\u2019s exercise as the postseason draws just a bit closer.\n\nSix to watch this weekend\n\nNo. 22 Loyola Chicago at Drake (noon Saturday; 3 p.m. Sunday, both games on ESPN2): It\u2019s the two-day series of the year in the Missouri Valley. Drake was 18-0 before its loss at Valparaiso on Sunday; it clobbered Northern Iowa on Wednesday in response. The visiting Ramblers (17-3, 12-1) have won 10 in a row and are darlings in both the NET (13th) and KenPom (15th).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNo. 12 Oklahoma at No. 14 West Virginia (1 p.m. Saturday): It\u2019s a matchup for second place in the Big 12, as Oklahoma (12-5, 7-4) tries to polish off a season sweep. The Mountaineers (14-5, 7-3) have turned back Kansas and Texas Tech by double-digit margins in their last two outings, though some late free throws courtesy of ejected Red Raiders coach Chris Beard helped widen things earlier this week in Lubbock.\n\nOregon at Arizona (2 p.m. Saturday, ESPN2): Barring some rescheduled games (namely trips to Southern California and UCLA), this might be the best opportunity left for the Ducks (11-4, 6-3 Pac-12) to impress in the regular season (a home game against Colorado could also help). Still, this isn\u2019t a vintage Arizona team. The postseason-ineligible Wildcats (14-6, 8-6) had dropped three of four before Thursday\u2019s victory over Oregon State.\n\nNo. 5 Villanova at No. 19 Creighton (5 p.m. Saturday, Fox): It\u2019s the first of two meetings for the top teams in the Big East. Villanova (13-2, 8-1) has won five of six since returning from a pause, while Creighton (15-5, 11-4) has avoided postponements and isn\u2019t scheduled to play again until Feb. 24.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNorth Carolina at No. 9 Virginia (6 p.m. Saturday, ESPN): Some postgame frivolity after a rivalry victory at Duke led to North Carolina\u2019s game against Miami getting shelved. The Tar Heels (12-6, 7-4 ACC) lost a play date, and now have to deal with league leader Virginia (14-3, 10-1) on the road. The Cavaliers have won six in a row in the series and haven\u2019t lost to North Carolina at home since 2012.\n\nNo. 3 Michigan at No. 21 Wisconsin (1 p.m. Sunday, CBS): The visiting Wolverines (13-1, 8-1 Big Ten) haven\u2019t played since Jan. 22 thanks to a departmentwide shutdown in Ann Arbor.

In the Eastern Conference, Kevin Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid are leading the way in the frontcourt, with Bradley Beal and Kyrie Irving in the backcourt. Out in the Western Conference, LeBron James, Nikola Jokic and Kawhi Leonard are pacing the frontcourt, while Stephen Curry and Luka Doncic are atop the backcourt.\n\nOnce the fan voting process is complete, players and members of the media will have a chance to cast their ballots, with the full starting lineups revealed Thursday. While the basketball world waits to find out whether the proposed All-Star Game will take place on March 7 in Atlanta, here are The Washington Post\u2019s picks for the 10 starter spots. The Post\u2019s selections for the rest of the rosters will be made next Sunday. (Note: these picks consider individual statistics, health and team success.)\n\nEastern Conference\n\nFrontcourt: Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers), Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks), and Kevin Durant (Brooklyn Nets)\n\nEmbiid finished third in the East fan vote, but he\u2019s worthy of the conference\u2019s first overall pick as the engine of the top-seeded 76ers. The 26-year-old center has bounced back from a disappointing showing in the bubble by captaining a top-five defense and posting a career-high 29.4 points, 10.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game. Philadelphia has posted a sterling 11-2 record in games that were within five points in the last five minutes thanks, in part, to Embiid stepping up in key moments.\n\nWhile Antetokounmpo has flown a bit under the radar since he signed his supermax contract extension in December, the back-to-back MVP continues to post monster statistics on a consistent winner. Despite shooting struggles at the free throw line and beyond the arc, the 26-year-old forward remains the lead option on the NBA\u2019s most efficient offense. He\u2019s averaged 28.1 points, 11.2 rebounds and 5.6 assists per game this year while enjoying near-perfect availability for the Bucks, who hold the East\u2019s second seed.\n\nThe only knock on Durant, 32, is that he has already missed nine games this season, in part because he has been sidelined twice for week-long quarantines because of contact tracing protocols. The 2014 MVP has picked up right where he left off before an Achilles\u2019 injury that cost him all of last season, averaging 29.5 points, 7.4 rebounds and 5.2 assists while shooting a sparkling 44.9 percent on three-pointers. That\u2019s plenty to earn a starter\u2019s selection over Milwaukee\u2019s Khris Middleton and Boston\u2019s Jayson Tatum, the next best candidates in this category.\n\nBackcourt: Jaylen Brown (Boston Celtics) and James Harden (Brooklyn Nets)\n\nBrown deserved to finish better than fourth among East guards in the fan vote because he separates himself from his top competition as a two-way force. At 24, Brown has made the most of an expanded role following the free agency departure of Gordon Hayward, posting a career-high 26 points, 5.6 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game while picking up playmaking duties when Kemba Walker was out injured. Brown\u2019s filled-out offensive game combined with his focused and physical defensive presence have helped keep the surprisingly shaky Celtics afloat.\n\nSome voters will surely penalize Harden for his indefensible antics as he forced his way off the Houston Rockets in December. Fair enough, but Harden, 31, remains the East\u2019s most devastating playmaking guard despite those warts. He\u2019s adjusted to a facilitating role in Brooklyn, averaging 23.9 points, 7 rebounds and 11 assists per game while playing setup man to Durant and Kyrie Irving.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn this ballot, Harden got the nod over Irving, who missed an extended stretch of the season due to personal reasons. Washington\u2019s Bradley Beal was a tough cut, but his league-leading scoring prowess was undercut by his unenthusiastic defense and the Wizards\u2019 abysmal record.\n\nWestern Conference\n\nFrontcourt: LeBron James (Los Angeles Lakers), Nikola Jokic (Denver Nuggets) and Kawhi Leonard (Los Angeles Clippers)\n\nThere are five strong candidates to start in the West frontcourt, but the fans nailed the best three.\n\nThe 36-year-old James was the overall leading vote-getter through the second round with 4.369 million votes, and he\u2019s raced to the front of the MVP conversation despite a shortened offseason. While James is averaging 25.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and 7.9 assists per game and leading the Lakers to the league\u2019s second-best record, his most impressive stat is zero. As in, zero games missed. Los Angeles enjoyed less than two months off between the 2020 Finals and the 2020-21 training camp, but the ageless James has appeared in every game so far during his 18th season.\n\nDenver isn\u2019t currently in the West\u2019s top tier, but Jokic has more than done his part by averaging 26.7 points, 11.3 rebounds and 8.6 assists per game. The 25-year-old big man is challenging Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s mark for the most assists per game by a center in NBA history, and he\u2019s stepped up his aggressiveness as a scorer to compensate for his inconsistent supporting cast. Without Jokic, who has somehow guided a top-five offense, the Nuggets would likely have one of the West\u2019s worst records.\n\nLeonard, 29, edged past Clippers forward Paul George and Lakers forward Anthony Davis to claim the West\u2019s third frontcourt spot on this ballot. The 2019 Finals MVP has averaged 26.5 points, 5.9 rebounds and 5 assists, carrying the Clippers to the West\u2019s most efficient offense and third-best record. Leonard\u2019s efficient scoring and disruptive defense have had an even bigger impact this season because he is no longer regularly missing time due to long term injury management.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGeorge had a strong case thanks to a sizzling start shooting the basketball, but a recent foot injury set him back. Davis has captained the NBA\u2019s stingiest defense, but his night-to-night impact has fluctuated as he has eased himself into this season after the Lakers\u2019 2020 title run. Look for Utah\u2019s Rudy Gobert to join George and Davis among the frontcourt reserves.\n\nBackcourt: Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors) and Damian Lillard (Portland Trail Blazers)\n\nTake it from Curry himself, who said this week that he is \u201c100 percent\u201d in the best groove of his illustrious career. The 32-year-old point guard has rebounded from an injury-plagued 2019-20 season to average 30 points, 5.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists, numbers that are nearly identical to his 2016 unanimous MVP season. Curry is threatening to record his second career 50/40/90 shooting campaign, and he has lifted the Warriors from the West\u2019s basement last season to a respectable 14-12 start. Simply put, he\u2019s been a sight to behold.\n\nThe toughest decision on this ballot came down to Lillard versus Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic. Both players are among the NBA\u2019s most exciting, and both have eye-popping stats. For comparison, Lillard, 30, has averaged 29 points, 4.4 rebounds and 7.2 assists per game to Doncic\u2019s 28.5 points, 8.7 rebounds and 9.4 assists per game.\n\nAD\n\nAD", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZQKQDWWWUZGANKR56IDKYGQELE.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9960535764694214}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "In the Eastern Conference , Kevin Durant , Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid are leading the way in the frontcourt , with Bradley Beal and Kyrie Irving in the backcourt. \n\n Eastern Conference \n\n Frontcourt : Joel Embiid ( Philadelphia 76ers ) , Giannis Antetokounmpo ( Milwaukee Bucks ) , and Kevin Durant ( Brooklyn Nets ) \n\n Embiid finished third in the East fan vote , but he \u2019s worthy of the conference \u2019s first overall pick as the engine of the top - seeded 76ers."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "6eebfe45-9a1f-48a0-99df-828b01fe7976", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "After a winter of uncertainty, MLB prepares for a complicated spring training", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/02/13/mlb-spring-training-starts-pandemic/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_sports", "description": "\u201cUncertainty\u201d is, and has been, the defining obstacle for everyone in baseball during the past year, and it will loom over the sport and all those invested in it as spring training begins.", "published": "Sat, 13 Feb 2021 08:30:29 EST", "body": "\u201cIf you was thinking signing Marcell Ozuna was easy, why didn\u2019t you do [it] after the season ended?\u201d\n\nAnthopolous dodged at first, but then a reporter re-upped the inquiry on Ozuna\u2019s behalf. Anthopolous, known for being tight-lipped about his team\u2019s personnel matters, finally relented.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of the offseason, there was a lot of uncertainty from a team payroll standpoint, from an industry standpoint,\u201d he said. Ozuna chuckled.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cUncertainty\u201d is, and has been, the defining obstacle for Major League Baseball the past year, and it will loom over the sport and all those invested in it as spring training begins in the coming days.\n\nThat the 2021 season would be played in a country still ravaged by the coronavirus has been certain for months now. But whether the league and its players could agree on terms by which to navigate the pandemic \u2014 whether owners would lose another year of ticket revenue, whether National League teams like the Braves would be allowed to use players like Ozuna as a designated hitter again, and so on \u2014 remained in flux until this week.\n\nAD\n\nUncertainty was central to both the league\u2019s and players\u2019 union\u2019s arguments throughout another winter of heated labor negotiations. MLB executives have had to factor it as they built rosters. Players have had to plan their normally meticulous routines around it.\n\nAD\n\nSuch is the tumult in which the sport is trying to start anew this month, even as a new strain of the virus emerges in Florida, and the old one continues to plague Arizona. Players have already begun to converge on their spring training facilities in both states, and they must now do so in time to complete a five-day quarantine before reporting to camp \u2014 a requirement of the health and safety protocol MLB and the MLBPA agreed to just a week before pitchers and catchers were scheduled to begin.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, a free agent slugger hitting the market after the kind of season Ozuna had in 2020 would have a variety of suitors with clear need for his services and money to spend. He led the National League in homers and finished third in on-base-plus-slugging. He is 30 years old, still in his prime.\n\nAD\n\nBut Ozuna stepped into free agency on far less stable ground. To start with, he had compiled those statistics in a shortened, unorthodox season that may or may not provide meaningful insight into his trajectory.\n\nOzuna also had compiled those numbers as a designated hitter. National League teams did not know until this month that they would not be allowed a DH in 2021. The size of Ozuna\u2019s market was likely halved when the MLB and players\u2019 union agreed to a deal without the universal designated hitter, since National League teams no longer had an obvious place to play him.\n\nAnd while the free agent market has moved slowly for many offseasons now, uncertainty added a new level of friction this time. Several teams, facing financial pressure amid the pandemic, chose to non-tender players they might have otherwise taken to arbitration, adding a glut of talent to the market that might not otherwise have been there. Closers Brad Hand and Archie Bradley, for example, were non-tendered and joined a relief market already brimming with options. The Cubs non-tendered outfielder Kyle Schwarber, then were able to replace him with a near-identical hitter in Joc Pederson \u2014 for less money than Schwarber got from his new team, the Washington Nationals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore free agent options did not necessarily make things easier for the teams, many of whom hedged their bets all winter.\n\nUntil recently, for example, Anthopolous could not have been certain whether he could sign Ozuna as a designated hitter, or whether he would be paying not only for his offense, but for his sometimes-suspect defense, too. Teams spent much of the offseason wondering how much of the usual ticket revenue they could count on \u2014 not only because of questions about whether fans would be able to attend games, but also because the length of the season had not been settled \u2014 and ended it still wondering when crowds could pour into stadiums again.\n\nBudgets remained in flux for many teams, even as many free agents were paid near traditional market values. The lack of a minor league season in 2020 complicated front offices\u2019 attempts to evaluate their own players.\n\n\u201cYou may not have the history to evaluate from last year, so you\u2019re just trying to take that one step at a time for who he is and plan player by player,\u201d Reds General Manager Nick Krall said in a call with reporters. Krall also acknowledged another complication facing executives: not only would evaluating their own players be more difficult than ever, but until this week, they did not know how many players they would be allowed to bring to spring training to evaluate.\n\nNot until Monday night did the league and players\u2019 union agree to health and safety guidance that capped the number of players allowed in any camp at 75. Instead of stashing top prospects at minor league camp and bringing them over to major league games for a few at-bats now and then, teams will now be inviting top prospects \u2014 even those a few years away from the big leagues \u2014 to major league camps.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLast year, the line between the big leagues and the minor leagues got blurred,\u201d Rangers President Jon Daniels told reporters Thursday. \u201cIn some ways, almost beyond last year, that certainly continues into this year and maybe permanently.\u201d\n\nDaniels admitted that for a rebuilding team like his, bringing more young players into major league camp becomes \u201ca feature, not a bug\u201d because auditioning veterans for one bench or bullpen spot is not a priority.\n\nBut with more minor leaguers headed to big league camps, fewer at-bats and innings may be available for the kind of veterans who use spring training to earn second chances, even as more veterans found themselves unsigned in the last week of the offseason.\n\nAD\n\nIn recent days, dozens of proven veterans have secured minor league deals with spring training invitations. Former all-stars such as Brandon Kintzler, Jed Lowrie and Jonathan Lucroy were among those to sign such deals since earlier this week.\n\nAD\n\nOrganizations are scrambling to address logistical problems beyond the player roster, too. Many teams normally bring a large contingent of staffers to camp each year and are having to figure out, on the fly, where they can cut back. At least one organization will do its in-game production from up north. Because last year\u2019s spring training eventually restarted as a summer camp at home ballparks, the impact of smaller staffs on spring training operations remains to be seen.\n\nThe sport, too, has had to scramble. The Grapefruit League schedule has been restructured to keep teams in smaller pods that limit travel. Instead of Florida\u2019s east coast teams traveling to the west coast hub around Tampa to play a few spring training games, those 15 teams will only play nearby clubs.\n\nAD\n\nAnd after announcing bulked-up contact tracing protocol that will require players to wear Kinexon tracers whenever they are working at team facilities, the league must secure enough of the devices and distribute them to organizations by early next week. According to a league spokesman, those tracers will be rolled out early in spring training.\n\nThe goal of those tracers, and of other additions to the health and safety rules, is to prevent a major outbreak, which could throw the season into limbo.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AX5U7TO6F5D6JKLXQPVRRMH56A.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9855391979217529}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "AD \n\n \u201c Uncertainty \u201d is , and has been , the defining obstacle for Major League Baseball the past year , and it will loom over the sport and all those invested in it as spring training begins in the coming days. \n\n That the 2021 season would be played in a country still ravaged by the coronavirus has been certain for months now."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "cdf31d72-02ab-4cc4-826a-bac328745c5c", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "In Zdeno Chara, the Capitals don\u2019t just have a defenseman.

He is also seen as a teacher in the league, someone with a willingness to help others.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost I think you have to be a good human being,\u201d said Chara, who spent more than a decade as captain of the Boston Bruins before he arrived in Washington on a one-year deal. \u201cYou know, I always try to respect people around me, the people that I interact with.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s this mind-set that has helped a lot of younger players Chara, 43, has interacted with over the years.\n\n\u201cIt is nice to see them do well,\u201d Chara said. \u201cIt is nice to see that they establish themselves in the National Hockey League and you kind of always feel like you have a good feeling, that you were kind of little part of that process.\u201d\n\nBoston defenseman Charlie McAvoy, 23, was Chara\u2019s defensive partner with the Bruins for three years. He still remembers the day he first met him in 2017. He described Chara as \u201clarger than life,\u201d with the 6-foot-9 captain towering over him as the two shook hands.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning I come in and just believe in him and I knew he was the best and if I had this guy in my corner and telling me things to do, I knew I needed to listen to him,\u201d McAvoy said.\n\nMcAvoy still describes Chara as a role model. On the ice, Chara taught a once-quiet McAvoy to communicate more, a skill that McAvoy now tries to pass on to the other Bruins blue-liners.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe puts everything together and still is such an incredible hockey player, which I feel like defies so many laws of physics and everything,\u201d said McAvoy, who called Chara his \u201con-the-fly teacher\u201d when he was first entering the league. \u201cHe truly is an incredible athlete.\u201d\n\nBoston winger David Pastrnak, who entered the Bruins locker room at age 18, also found a guide in Chara, who showed him how to carry himself both on and off the ice.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe [taught] me how to be a pro, to be honest,\u201d Pastrnak said. \u201cSounds like one of the simplest things. But at the same time, for a young player to become a real pro and act like a pro and behave, it\u2019s not always easy.\u201d\n\nWashington Capitals great Peter Bondra, who played with and against Chara throughout his NHL career, considers Chara a good friend. The two have houses next to each other in Slovakia and see each other on occasion.\n\nAD\n\nHe can attest to Chara\u2019s legendary workouts, which, according to Bondra, happen four to five times a day. A few years ago, Bondra\u2019s two sons, who are now 24 and 28, asked to work out with the NHLer. He not only obliged, he also wrote down a full routine for the pair to follow in the future.\n\nAD\n\nBondra said his boys still use the workout tips and the papers are still in his basement.\n\nEarly in Chara\u2019s career, when he played for the New York Islanders, Bondra had to remind Chara that if he treated him like a friend, he would find himself in the coach\u2019s office the next day. The day after Bondra gave Chara that advice, Chara hit him so hard during a game that he \u201cflipped like a cat.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously we talked after that game and we laughed, but I felt like a train hit me or something,\u201d Bondra said.\n\nBondra said he was thrilled that Chara landed in Washington.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI felt like, \u2018Wow great, coach has a coach in the locker room,\u2019 \u201d Bondra said. \u201cI think that was great move, especially with new coach Peter Laviolette coming to a new team and bring Z at the same time, I believe that is a big help with the transition.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA month into the season, the addition of Chara has already made an impact on a Capitals room filled with leaders.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a leader, everyone looks up to him and he\u2019s certainly not just looking around trying to make assumptions about people,\u201d said defenseman John Carlson. \u201cHe wants to get to know you and to be a part of the process.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s players routinely note that whenever Chara speaks, everyone listens. His notorious gym routine is carefully watched and his on-ice tendencies have players asking the veteran more and more questions.\n\n\u201cWhen you see him walk around, when you see him in the gym, there\u2019s just that feeling that he puts off, that vibe that he puts off that just makes everyone around him want to get better,\u201d winger Tom Wilson said. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing leader \u2026 I\u2019ve found myself getting better just being around him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMcAvoy, speaking from experience, echoed Wilson\u2019s statement and took it a bit further, encouraging the Capitals players to not \u201ctake a second for granted.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be able to say you played with him, I know for me personally, it is something I am going to be telling my kids about one day,\u201d McAvoy said. \u201c \u2026 to be able to say I was Zdeno Chara\u2019s d-partner for three years is something I will have forever, something I definitely don\u2019t take for granted at all.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BGHXN56JUJDBRKCB57KJT4ZX5E.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9770686626434326}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Boston defenseman Charlie McAvoy , 23 , was Chara \u2019s defensive partner with the Bruins for three years. \n\n McAvoy still describes Chara as a role model."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "86847b91-83be-46b8-8b3e-a2e6d3b83f23", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "It\u2019s hard to find children\u2019s books with Black characters, so a coach\u2019s family wrote its own", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/02/12/maryland-basketball-childrens-book/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_sports", "description": "Tierra and DeAndre Haynes, a Maryland basketball assistant, want their boys to see an array of career paths. So Tierra wrote a children's book about the first African American to go to space.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 04:00:07 EST", "body": "Around the same time, Haynes\u2019s oldest son, DeAndre Jr., realized he was one of the only Black kids in his class. Conversations during Black History Month felt uncomfortable when the other third graders looked toward him. That planted the idea in Haynes\u2019s mind. Her kids \u2014 and all kids \u2014 needed to know more about important Black figures in American history. She imagined writing a children\u2019s book to help fill the void. But her life was busy, raising three boys and investing in dozens of others who played basketball for her husband\u2019s teams, so the thought remained nothing more than an unfinished idea.\n\nDeAndre Haynes\u2019s job took the family from Toledo to Michigan and now to the University of Maryland, where he\u2019s an assistant basketball coach. His family\u2019s life orbits sports. Little Dre, 13, plays AAU basketball, and 7-year-old Devon loves football. Their childhood has been packed with role models by way of their dad\u2019s basketball teams. They consider former Michigan player Jordan Poole a brother, and when Devon recently gave his mom a list of people to invite to his virtual birthday party, he included former Terps Anthony Cowan Jr. and Jalen Smith. Ask Little Dre what he wants to be when he grows up, and he will say an NBA player. If not that, maybe he would coach like his dad.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTierra Haynes half-hoped she would pass a bookstore and see somebody else had written the books she envisioned, but the void remained. And then this spring, following the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd and too many others, she realized she couldn\u2019t wait.\n\n\u201cIt became painfully clear to me that these were stories that needed to be told,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cIt became very important to me for my boys to not only have the news or the NBA to see images of other Black men.\u201d\n\nWhile at home during the pandemic, Haynes wrote for months. She long ago landed on Guion Bluford Jr., the first African American to go to space, as an ideal character. By the fall, Haynes had finished a manuscript for a book that follows her three sons on a trip to space, where they meet and learn about Bluford. A couple of weeks ago, she finally held a hardback copy of her book, \u201cThe Adventures of Us: Getting to Know Guion Bluford Jr.,\u201d and now it\u2019s landing in the hands of other children.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTierra and DeAndre Haynes want their boys to see an array of career paths. Little Dre has lately become interested in videography, and his parents have pointed out the member of Maryland basketball\u2019s staff who does that work. Devon enjoys art, and 6-year-old Dallas loves animals.\n\n\u201cWe try to tell them that: Your life doesn't have to be just sports,\u201d DeAndre Haynes said. \u201cYou look at it out here, man, there are so many successful people who are not doing something with a basketball, with a ball, on a field, on a court. And we want them to know that.\u201d\n\nWhen Haynes was a kid in Detroit, he watched the Pistons and their rival Michael Jordan. \u201cI didn\u2019t see other successful Black people,\u201d he said, and basketball launched Haynes to the life he has now. He was a standout point guard for Kent State before playing overseas. But even decades later, during team conversations about racial injustice last summer, Haynes realized some of his players were unaware of important Black individuals in American history.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs parents, Haynes and his wife found books with diverse characters for their kids to read, \u201cbut it had to be intentional,\u201d Tierra said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t typically something that you would just stumble upon.\u201d In the room where they now attend virtual school, she hung posters of Thurgood Marshall and Bessie Coleman. It\u2019s all part of the effort to reinforce that they can do anything. That\u2019s the purpose of the book, which Haynes hopes is the first in a series.\n\nAfter Haynes had the idea while living in Ohio, then settled on Bluford as the character while living in Michigan, her husband found an illustrator because of his ties at the University of Maryland. Nearly two years ago, an assistant coach for the Terrapins\u2019 women\u2019s basketball team posted a digital drawing of her staff, noting that her friend Morgan Jennings had created the image. DeAndre, who had long believed in his wife\u2019s idea for a book, immediately contacted Jennings and Kaitlynn Fratz, the Maryland assistant. The first question he asked Jennings: \u201cCan you draw Black people?\u201d Realistic illustrations were nonnegotiable.\n\nJennings played college basketball at California University of Pennsylvania, where she became close friends with Fratz. During college, Jennings gravitated toward art and incorporated Black characters and culture into her work \u2014 \u201call I had ever wanted to do was work for Disney so that I could see myself as a character,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen working on this book, Haynes wanted the three boys to undoubtedly look like her sons. Jennings said she drew the spacesuits specifically so they would not cover the boys\u2019 hair. When Dallas dreams of being an astronaut on the final page, Jennings didn\u2019t want the thought bubble to show a silhouette or the back of a head. It needed to be \u201chim as a Black man on the moon,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s important. They need to see that. It\u2019s little details that we really focused on to make sure the idea of representation is definitely there.\u201d\n\nHaynes\u2019s children had a role in the design process, offering feedback to Jennings. Little Dre wanted his character to also wear glasses, and they made sure Devon had the gap between his front teeth. Dallas said he wants to learn how to do a backflip soon, so Jennings drew him upside-down while floating through space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHaynes chose Bluford as the subject of her first book a few years ago because, at the time, her boys were interested in space. She knew that would be a visually appealing topic to make learning fun. She wants her boys to become even more involved moving forward, letting them chose possible topics to explore. Little Dre suggested the next book be about an important woman in Black history \u201cso that it could be equal,\u201d the 13-year-old said, explaining how a young Black girl could see herself in these books, too.\n\nBasketball will always be an integral piece of their lives. And if Little Dre wants to be a professional basketball player, his parents are going to help him get there. Subtle reminders of the sport appear in the book: Little Dre is holding a ball on one page, and later, Dallas calls Bluford \u201cthe Michael Jordan of astronauts.\u201d But basketball \u2014 and dreams of becoming an astronaut, an architect or a doctor \u2014 can intersect.\n\nAt some of her husband\u2019s previous coaching stops, the team\u2019s players have read books at local schools. That\u2019s one of the visions she has with the book \u2014 to have the Jordan Pooles and Jalen Smiths of the world read to kids, highlighting these paths of possibility.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XONA6QSGV5EUTA2NQUOVMSAYRM.JPG&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.6327069401741028}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "DeAndre Haynes \u2019s job took the family from Toledo to Michigan and now to the University of Maryland , where he \u2019s an assistant basketball coach.

Terms were not disclosed.\n\nHoppe\u2019s exploits launched him into the national team conversation as a busy year of tournaments and 2022 World Cup qualifying commences. U.S. Coach Gregg Berhalter will consider summoning him for friendlies in Europe in late March. He also could land with the under-23 squad vying for an Olympic berth.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to get ahead of ourselves,\" Berhalter cautioned. \u201cA player establishes himself by continuing to perform at this level. It\u2019s great to see him reach these heights, and now he needs to maintain it. And if he does that, I am sure he will get an opportunity with the national team.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHoppe\u2019s run has cooled: four consecutive appearances without a goal for a club that, after 10 top-five finishes the previous 16 seasons, is last with a 1-14-5 record entering Saturday\u2019s visit to Union Berlin and in danger of tumbling into the second division for the first time since 1991.\n\nHe is no longer catching opponents by surprise.\n\n\u201cBefore, people didn\u2019t really know who I was, but now I hear the defenders always saying my name or my number to the other defender,\u201d Hoppe said. \u201cThey are always making sure they have an eye on me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHoppe\u2019s uncommon ascent began in typical youth soccer circles. He played for clubs near his home in Yorba Linda, Calif., experienced European tours and joined the Los Angeles Galaxy\u2019s academy.\n\nAD\n\nWhen that MLS pathway didn\u2019t pan out, Hoppe, at age 16, enrolled in a residency academy in Casa Grande, Ariz., run by FC Barcelona, the Spanish superpower.\n\nHe had always been a midfielder, but at the Barcelona academy, coaches decided to try him at forward. The goals flowed.\n\n\u201cI kept telling [the coach] to put me back at midfield,\u201d Hoppe said. \u201cHe kept saying I have natural instincts.\u201d\n\nHoppe became the leading scorer in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy, a national web of top-tier youth academies and clubs.\n\nBarcelona arranged a two-week stay at La Masia, the club\u2019s famed developmental center in Spain. He also received tryouts with several German clubs, including Schalke.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHoppe had planned to enroll at San Diego State, but the pull of Europe became too strong. In June 2019, he signed with Schalke. The first step was the U-19 squad, for which he scored five goals.\n\nThis season, Hoppe was promoted to the U-23 team competing in the German fourth division. Though his production was modest (one goal in 16 matches), the organization believed he was on track for first-team opportunities. Besides, Schalke\u2019s awful season heightened the need to introduce fresh talent.\n\nIn a training game against the first team last fall, Hoppe scored for the U-23s.\n\n\u201cSince then, they called me up and I trained well,\u201d he said. \u201cThey gave me the chance to make my debut, and I haven\u2019t looked back.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHoppe\u2019s Bundesliga debut came in a Nov. 28 start. In his third start, on Jan. 9, he ran wild against Hoffenheim and became the first Schalke player to record a hat trick since December 2014.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was hard to believe at first,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was hard to process and realize it was real and it happened. But once I got those [goals], my confidence went up, and I was able to feel a lot more confident and show what I am capable of.\u201d\n\nAt 6-foot-3, Hoppe is a natural target. But he also displays quality footwork and a killer instinct around the goal. In March, when the coronavirus pandemic shut down sports leagues around the world, Hoppe returned to California and worked on his game.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor four months, I figured out things I needed to improve: my first touch, shooting,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked on it every day. I returned with all those things under my belt.\u201d\n\nHoppe\u2019s skill set appeals to Berhalter. While the national team has a wealth of attacking players, many of whom are performing at high levels in Europe, there is a dearth of strikers. Jozy Altidore is 31, and Josh Sargent, who turns 21 this month, is finding his way at Germany\u2019s Werder Bremen.\n\nAD\n\nOthers, such as 20-year-old Nicholas Gioacchini, are in the mix.\n\n\u201cWhat I really liked is the transition moments, the moments when Schalke won the ball,\u201d Berhalter said of Hoppe. \u201cThere was space behind the defense he was able to really take advantage of with really clever movement. And then when he got into position to score goals, he finished them off with cleverness and really good effort.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHoppe was in the U.S. under-20 team\u2019s plans last year until the pandemic wiped out the schedule.\n\nHe said he is \u201clooking forward to whatever the U.S. national team has for me, and I can\u2019t wait.\u201d He was doing whatever he could, he said, to show he deserved a call-up.\n\nHis primary concern, however, is helping lift Schalke from the bottom of the Bundesliga. Two teams will fall to the second division, and a third will enter a playoff.\n\nAD\n\nRelegation would be a massive embarrassment for a club that reached the Champions League\u2019s round of 16 five of the previous 10 seasons and made the semifinals in 2011.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where all my focus is right now,\u201d he said.\n\nThough he has established his Bundesliga credentials, Hoppe remains a wide-eyed newcomer. After a recent defeat to Bayern Munich, he made a point of seeking out superstar Robert Lewandowski and requesting his jersey.\n\n\u201cEverything changed so fast,\u201d Hoppe said. \u201cThere have been some moments where I was able to take a step back and look at all that\u2019s happened. It is crazy. It is like my dream is coming true, and it\u2019s been special for me.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GLCC37VHPJFOZDNKNBQZX7PEMU.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9992173314094543}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "AD \n\n Hoppe ( pronounced Hop - E ) scored three goals in 21 minutes bridging halftime as Schalke defeated Hoffenheim , 4 - 0 , and ended a 30 - game winless streak in league play.

Why play the national anthem at sporting events at all?\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s worth mulling. At a time when we need whatever unity we can find and sports might be one place to find it, the anthem could be a two-minute span when we agree that we\u2019re all Americans, that we should be together rather than separate. It could remind us that \u2014 not very long ago \u2014 we had more in common than we did not. It\u2019s a nice way to think, at least.\n\nI also note that watching athletes find their voices and draw attention to their passions by kneeling during the anthem has been inspiring. Not everyone will agree, of course; indeed, there are those who are offended \u2014 and deeply. But Colin Kaepernick became an icon bigger and more important than football because the anthem was played pregame and he chose to kneel.\n\nAD\n\nYes, that inspired a president to say any football player who followed Kaepernick\u2019s lead is a \u201cson of a bitch.\u201d But it also helped other athletes take up the issues Kaepernick was highlighting \u2014 police violence that disproportionately affects Black Americans and the social inequities and injustice behind that reality. With no pregame anthem, maybe there\u2019s no way for the NBA to spread that message as powerfully as players did last summer in Orlando. Those images \u2014 two teams kneeling, together \u2014 they resonate, and they matter.\n\nAD\n\nBut there\u2019s also plenty of reason to wonder whether the anthem\u2019s time as a mandatory precursor to athletic events has passed. For one, it\u2019s clearly watered down. Hearing it so often \u2014 162 times in a baseball season, half that in basketball or hockey \u2014 makes each version less special. At most ballparks and arenas, there\u2019s a hot dog-buying, finding-my-seat murmur beneath the song.\n\nAD\n\nThere\u2019s also something silly about the ritual. When the Washington Capitals host the Philadelphia Flyers, they play only \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d because, ostensibly, both teams are American. When, say, the Toronto Maple Leafs are in town, they add, \u201cO Canada.\u201d Either way, the players from Russia and Sweden and the Czech Republic \u2014 as well as the United States and Canada \u2014 take to the ice when the anthem(s) are over. Who are we honoring here?\n\nAD\n\nBut in capitulating to the NBA\u2019s wishes Wednesday, Cuban made some sense. He pointed out in a statement that he had always stood for the anthem at Mavericks games, with his hand over his heart.\n\n\u201cBut we also hear the voices of those who do not feel the anthem represents them,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe feel they also need to be respected and heard, because they have not been heard.\n\n\u201cThe hope is that those who feel passionate about the anthem being played will be just as passionate in listening to those who do not feel it represents them.\u201d\n\nSo here we are, at a moment when this little act \u2014 singing this 80-word song about a battle viewed from afar more than two centuries ago \u2014 can mean different things to different people. Those who want to wrap themselves in the flag and believe the song conveys what it means to be an American \u2014 \u201cO\u2019er the land of the free and the home of the brave\u201d \u2014 can absolutely believe that. But there also must be room for those who believe America isn\u2019t as inclusive as it professes to be and that we need to keep working to reach those ideals.\n\nDropping the anthem from pregame rituals would be a convenient way to drop the conversation, to artificially isolate sports from everything the country is grappling with. But if 2020 showed anything, it\u2019s that sports are inseparable from the issues society faces every year and every day. Athletes have powerful and important and informed voices, and they should be encouraged to use them. Fans have diverse beliefs in the value of rising as one, and that matters, too. There should be room for both views \u2014 and a time and a place to air them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf the anthem hadn\u2019t been sung before baseball games for close to a century, would I be suggesting we add it now? No, of course not. But it is a tradition with ties to normalcy \u2014 and not an insignificant history. From Jos\u00e9 Feliciano at the 1968 World Series to Whitney Houston at the Super Bowl in 1991, from moments both roiling and patriotic, there is a tradition here, and stripping sports of that feels too of the moment, too quick.\n\nI have zero problem with Cuban initially deciding not to play the anthem at Mavericks games this season. His choice already achieved what we all should want: further discussion on what it means to be American. Hermetically sealing off sports from the rest of society isn\u2019t a way to accomplish that. From the highest-profile pros to college kids and even high-schoolers, athletes have reimagined those two minutes as a time to grapple with our country\u2019s triumphs and failings. Taking that away doesn\u2019t feel like progress.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe anthem is polarizing because we live in a polarized society. But if striking it from pregame ceremonies would be reactionary, standing and singing in a lemur-like way isn\u2019t especially meaningful.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMK4RVMUJVDR7O6CLGGRF3WPAY.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9845274686813354}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "But Colin Kaepernick became an icon bigger and more important than football because the anthem was played pregame and he chose to kneel.

Roger Goodell has shown plenty of flawed judgment over his 15-odd years as NFL commissioner, but if ever a leader deserves credit for rising to a crisis and putting on this implausibly successful season, he does. Give the man and his staff a bonus, and don\u2019t leave out his SWAT epidemiologist, Christina Mack, or NFL chief medical officer Allen Sills and NFLPA medical director Thom Mayer, either. Beginning with the makeshift virtual draft back in April \u2014 which could have been a snarl-up but instead turned into a bravura display of coordination, not to mention crackling good television \u2014 straight through the Super Bowl, the NFL was an example of logistical excellence under pressure. You can debate the wisdom or morals of playing on, but you can\u2019t debate the execution.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, there was a command structure: It was very clear how to get things done, when to get things done and who was going to do them,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, an infectious-disease expert and member of President Biden\u2019s coronavirus advisory team who spoke at an NFL-organized pandemic roundtable during Super Bowl week. \u201cIt was always very organized. Oftentimes I see situations where there isn\u2019t a command structure in place like that, and it takes days sometimes to come to a certain point that in this command structure sometimes took an hour to happen.\u201d\n\nThe NFL is always campaigning to be more than just badly needed amusement, to crawl more deeply into American cultural importance, and it\u2019s not always the healthiest enterprise. But in this instance, it may have performed a real public service. The massive test-and-trace data it forwarded to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 more than 950,000 tests given to 7,500 players and staff, as well as readouts from proximity trackers \u2014 yielded critical enlightenment about coronavirus transmissibility in workplaces. One thing the data showed was that the league\u2019s low positivity rate wasn\u2019t just accomplished with deep pockets and clout, though it used both of those. Lots of people and organizations have thrown money at the pandemic problem without these kinds of results.\n\nThe really valuable finding by the CDC and NFL is that it was the less resource-intensive protocols such as mask-wearing and strict quarantining that were most effectual, and those can be applied to businesses, schools and places of worship without enormous cost. The NFL spent a fortune proving it doesn\u2019t have to cost a fortune. The Seattle Seahawks under Coach Pete Carroll went from August to February without a positive test, using a lot of plexiglass, fresh air and distancing. Goodell and Sills said at the outset that they hoped to use the season to \u201ccontribute knowledge and insights that will aid the country\u2019s pandemic response.\u201d And they did.\n\nA joint paper produced by the CDC and the NFL is worthwhile reading for every office manager in America. What the league discovered through its exhaustive efforts \u2014 and various outbreaks and setbacks from Baltimore to Tennessee \u2014 is that in-person meetings of even less than 15 minutes indoors could sicken people, with poor ventilation and no masking. Ride-shares are a bad idea \u2014 NFL data showed that exposure can result from simply driving friends to work. Cafeteria lines are hotspots and break rooms, too. Air flow is critical. Outdoor events are largely safe. And nothing beats masking up. What led to an outbreak, every time, was masklessness. Hear that, Rand Paul?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was uniform mask-wearing. It was outdoor activity. It was avoiding in-person meetings. It was avoiding meals together. It was avoiding sharing rides,\u201d Sills said during a panel discussion last week. \u201cThese are the lessons and these are strategies that can be applied by organizations no matter what their resources. \u2026 It\u2019s not about how frequently you test. It\u2019s not about the proximity tracking devices. It\u2019s about those basics. And I\u2019ve said many times that avoiding transmission is not complicated. It\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s not complicated. It\u2019s just something that has to be done every single day by everyone in the organization and done uniformly. And if it happens, you can keep people safe.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s most striking in the CDC paper is how the NFL coordinated so many different elements, departments, realms of expertise and disparate groups of people. Epidemiologists worked with football operations. Athletic trainers became contact tracers. Goodell and union head DeMaurice Smith partnered to revise protocols, proving that management and labor could \u201cget something done,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThen there was the cooperation of players, who with an average age of about 26 were in the nation\u2019s highest transmission group and yet kept their positivity rate so low, which they only could have done with supreme discipline not just in the facilities but at home. \u201cNobody wanted to be \u2018that guy,\u2019 the guy who brought it in,\u2019\u201d said Anthony Casolaro, head of the NFL Physicians Society. \u201cYou get some of the key athletes to just say, \u2018This is what we do,\u2019 and the younger guys all follow suit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe NFL had its share of problems, and it no doubt will again as it heads into another offseason of uncertainty, of variants and vaccines. \u201cThe whole concept wasn\u2019t to avoid positives; we knew that was not possible,\u201d Goodell said at his annual Super Bowl news conference. But the organization and rigor it brought to herculean logistical experiments are an example for the whole country. If you want a model for how to manage a large business amid the pandemic, how to make solid yet adaptable judgments in the face of tremendous uncertainty, well, there it is.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T7PVHGMF6RAJLN5WITV5XSNUJY.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9993754029273987}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The NFL is always campaigning to be more than just badly needed amusement , to crawl more deeply into American cultural importance , and it \u2019s not always the healthiest enterprise.

It failed in August 2015 because the national board said it considered college athletics beyond its jurisdiction. It ignored a ruling in March 2014 by the Chicago regional NLRB director, Peter Sung Ohr, that football players at Northwestern in suburban Chicago (my alma mater, for full disclosure) were no less school employees than any wage earners on campus and were entitled to organize.\n\nAD\n\nWell, guess whom Biden picked five days after his inauguration to supplant Robb? Ohr, who became acting general counsel Jan. 25.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to have a great amount of discretion and direction on how much [the NLRB is] going to enforce, if any, the rights of players,\u201d John Adam, a Michigan labor lawyer who represented the Northwestern players, said this past weekend. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s sending a message. He may have been selected for many reasons unrelated to the Northwestern matter. But having him there, I think, is a good sign for the players, and workers in general. He\u2019ll be much better than the prior general counsel.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean Ohr can immediately pick up where he was cut off years ago. College football and basketball players, who are predominantly Black males, aren\u2019t about to get the paychecks, workers\u2019 comp and long-term health-care insurance they deserve next semester. I wish it would be that easy, but it won\u2019t be.\n\nAD\n\nIt will take agitation, again. It will require another lot of players, like Northwestern\u2019s football team, to demand a unionizing petition. Or it will take some current or former player to file an unfair labor practice charge.\n\nBut the atmosphere is more ripe for either of those events than when Colter et al. garnered Ohr\u2019s ruling. And that ruling was rejected mostly on a technical interpretation and not, as Griffin affirmed, on merit.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy sense is that between the organizing from last summer, and the continuing emergence and empowerment of women\u2019s teams, that it would be possible to get more than one team to do this and more than one sport,\u201d Ithaca College professor Ellen Staurowsky, who long has advocated for more equitable treatment of college athletes, wrote in an email last week. \u201cI might be way too optimistic in that view, but with women\u2019s basketball teams opting out of playing the remainder of their seasons because of health concerns, it seems the time is ripe to move this agenda forward.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nStaurowsky was referencing the Virginia women, who opted out of their season in January. And the SMU team that called it quits just before New Year\u2019s. And the Duke team that on Christmas decided not to play this season. All packed it in because of coronavirus worries.\n\nThose decisions came on the heels of a halting college football season that had bowl games canceled because eligible teams didn\u2019t want to chance pandemic travel, rivalry games called off, some conferences deciding not to play at all and those that did doing so in sparsely populated or empty stadiums. Many of those decisions were influenced by players and their families being uncomfortable carrying on their athletic careers while most everyone else associated with college campuses were being ordered to stay away.\n\nThen there were the athletes emboldened last summer by protests across the country against lethal police acts against Black men and the systemic societal problems that made them possible. Pac-12 football players threatened to boycott practice and play until they got assurances about their well-being and social justice concerns. Mississippi football players said they no longer wanted to play with the state\u2019s flag featuring the Confederate battle symbol flapping over their heads. A statue was moved and sheathed; the state banner was changed. Star Black players such as Oklahoma State\u2019s Chuba Hubbard called out their White coaches for being insensitive to the sensibilities of those who make up most of their rosters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get players who are beholden to the university, loyal to the coach, to take a stand, even if they\u2019re not, as in the case of the Northwestern players, really criticizing the university,\u201d Adam said. \u201cNormally, when you have an election campaign, people are complaining about something: wages or benefits, whatever. So it\u2019s more hostile. Here, they were doing it because they thought [Northwestern] was the place to do it, this was the university that would be the most receptive to it. Kain was praising the coach and the university. It wasn\u2019t an attack upon them. It was a bigger issue: We need a voice, not just here, but elsewhere.\u201d\n\nThe Northwestern players did vote on whether to form a union. The tally was never revealed. And after Ohr\u2019s ruling was vetoed, their ballots were destroyed.\n\nBut the argument those players raised about the inequity of college sports didn\u2019t dissipate.

They were part of an anti-establishment counterculture that feared being co-opted by people who didn\u2019t understand the dance or its dizzying band of denizens.\n\nThe story of breaking\u2019s meteoric rise to the Olympic stage \u2014 it\u2019s set to make its debut at the Paris Summer Games in 2024 \u2014 involved an unlikely and reluctant partnership between street-savvy breakers and traditional ballroom dancers, an evolution of an urban art form into a competitive endeavor and a lightning-fast education campaign to sell Olympic officials and a curious sporting public that breakers are very much athletes.\n\n\u201cMost of us knew that this could be big one day. We just didn\u2019t really know how it would happen,\u201d said veteran b-boy Moises Rivas, who dances under the name \u201cMoy.\u201d \u201cBut it has always had a path. We just had to deal with the misconceptions, negative connotations and people who didn\u2019t always want to give it the credibility it deserves.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBorn in the South Bronx nearly 50 years ago, breaking long ago had spread across the world and become far more nuanced than what was commercialized by 1980s pop culture and mass media. By 2010, there were independent competitions around the world and veteran instructors operating in most major cities. Breaking was still an activity that could be done by tossing a piece of cardboard on a sidewalk and letting the music take hold, but for many, it had graduated from the sidewalks to dance studios.\n\nIn other large cities, from Los Angeles to Miami, there were parallel efforts to grow the sport but little coordination. Steve Graham had dabbled in breaking in college in the early 1980s. He worked on Wall Street and then established a successful private equity firm in Philadelphia. He gravitated back to breaking in his 50s, dancing alongside his children. He saw the potential for growth. The dance wasn\u2019t just a form of expression; competition was baked into it with fierce dance battles between b-boys and b-girls.\n\nHe ran a popular competition in Philadelphia and established a Pro Breaking Tour and a nonprofit membership organization called Urban Dance & Educational Foundation with a vision of drawing together the fragmented breaking world. Many of the competitions were spectacles, drawing large crowds with elaborate lights and window-rattling beats, but the sport was driven by independent event promoters without any movement trained on the Olympics.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFar removed from booming bass notes and twirling young b-boys, however, serious efforts were afoot to get other forms of dancing on sport\u2019s biggest stage. The global governing body was called International DanceSport, an umbrella organization for all dance disciplines, from Boogie Woogie to salsa. It was formally recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1997, but officials there failed in their efforts to get ballroom dancing accepted into a Summer Games. Rather than pack up their tap shoes, they rebranded as the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF) and decided to double-down, buoyed by the popularity of television shows such as \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d and the public\u2019s growing interest in dance competitions.\n\nBreaking was far from the organization\u2019s core when WDSF enlisted the help of Jean-Laurent Bourquin, an IOC veteran, in 2015, asking him for his help in wooing Olympic officials. The WDSF leaders were hopeful they could push specific styles of dance \u2014 either Latin or rock-and-roll \u2014 but after consulting with his colleagues in the Olympic world, Bourquin surprised them.\n\n\u201cI had to be frank,\u201d Bourquin said in a recent interview.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDancing would be a viable candidate for the Olympics, he told them, but not the style they were used to.\n\nResistance on two fronts\n\nThe WDSF\u2019s top governing board included no breakers, so the proposition was something of a quandary: The organization could realize its Olympic dream, but only with a rogue, largely unfamiliar discipline.\n\n\u201cIt was a bitter pill that was hard for everyone to swallow,\u201d recalled Ken Richards, who was on the board at the time and is now president of USA Dance. \u201cEveryone had that feeling that the dances all worked together. So we had to come to this understanding and agreement that if dance can get a foot in the door with a style the IOC wants, then maybe the other dances aren\u2019t as far behind as we feared.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBourquin planted a seed with the IOC in 2016 and traveled to the Rio Olympics to chat up IOC members. He was named interim president of the WDSF and convinced leadership to relocate its headquarters from Barcelona to Lausanne, Switzerland, where the IOC is based. Rather than target the 2020 Tokyo Olympics or even Paris in 2024, he strategically set sights lower. Bourquin wanted to see breaking at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, a more apt platform and a friendly way to introduce the sport to Olympic officials, who skew older.\n\nAD\n\nFor many in the Olympic world, it was the first time they considered dancing a true sport. And for many in the breaking world, it was the first time they considered the Olympics a realistic goal.\n\nWithin the breaking community, there have always been factions focused on the art and the performance, and others who thrive on battles and competition. Other lifestyle sports, such as skateboarding or surfing, had struggled with an existential dissonance with members rebuffing mainstream acceptance or organized events.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t view their talent as a sport,\u201d Zavian recalled, \u201cso I had one of the skateboarders come to our meeting and talk about the difference between a sport and art. It was a very heated topic: \u2018You\u2019re going to take our culture away. You\u2019re going to take our art away.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMore than 2,000 people signed a 2017 online petition that was sent to the IOC titled, \u201cGet the WDSF\u2019s Hands Off Hip-Hop.\u201d Organized by Serouj Aprahamian, a Lebanese-Armenian breaker, the petition accused the WDSF of trying \u201cto exploit breaking as a Trojan horse to get its foot in the door of the Olympics.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWould the IOC allow the Badminton World Federation to oversee baseball? Would it allow the Federation for Equestrian Sports to oversee auto racing? Why would the Olympics accept such a polar opposite and illegitimate entity as the WDSF to have anything to do with breaking?\u201d the petition asked.\n\nAD\n\nBut the ball was moving. While Graham provided much of the funding, the critical push for the Summer Youth Olympics was spearheaded by the larger dancing community, not the breakers. Bourquin knew there was a long list of criteria that needed to be satisfied to gain admittance to the Olympics. Breaking, for so long, had operated differently from event to event, city to city. It needed to be codified with universal rules, judging and protocols.\n\nWDSF assembled committees and panels to prepare for the Summer Youth Olympics, enlisting the help of breakers such as Rivas. Outsiders were skeptical, unsure how the dance would translate to a competitive format and how it would engage spectators.\n\nAD\n\nRivas recalls walking into the venue in Buenos Aires and being greeted by a massive \u2014 and curious \u2014 crowd of several thousand.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou could see it on their faces,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first, it was almost like disgust: \u2018How is this real?\u2019 But no one moved. The crowd kept getting bigger. And you could just see their faces change. It was amazing. I knew then that there was no way this wouldn\u2019t make the Olympic stage.\u201d\n\nYouth prevails\n\nBourquin had been checking off boxes that he knew would impress Olympic officials. He still can rattle off the key items from the IOC\u2019s Olympic Agenda 2020, its forward-looking, 40-point reform document produced in 2014.\n\n\u201cNumber six was to trigger youth involvement and benefit the host community. Nine limited the number of athletes to 10,500; I\u2019m only asking for a quota of 32: 16 b-boys and 16 b-girls. Number 11, foster gender equality,\u201d he said. \u201cTwelve, reduce costs. Twenty-three, engage with communities. Twenty-six, blend sport and culture.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBaseball and softball were eager to get back to the Summer Games, but they required expensive stadiums and large rosters of athletes. Bourquin explained to everyone in Buenos Aires that breaking was inexpensive to produce and targeted a young demographic that otherwise might not tune in.\n\nIOC President Thomas Bach was particularly impressed, Bourquin said, and everyone noticed that breaking turned in bigger social media numbers than any other sport in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe Paris 2024 organizers were on board, and barely five months later the IOC\u2019s executive board recommend provisionally adding the dance discipline to the Summer Games. Breaking was formally approved for Paris last month, the same time skateboarding, sports climbing and surfing, all youth-oriented sports, were retained from the Tokyo Olympics slate.\n\nBreaking\u2019s quick ascent as an Olympic-level competition has complicated its governance issues and stirred mixed feelings across the sprawling dance community.\n\nIt\u2019s an awkward marriage to be sure, non-breakers suddenly charged with championing an unfamiliar discipline, still holding out hope their preferred style of dance will someday impress Olympic organizers. Graham remembers a quarter-century ago when snowboarders made a splash on the Olympic stage but found themselves under the organizational control of ski-centric bodies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a completely different demographic,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThe breakers aren\u2019t ones who you can just regulate. That doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t collaborate, but it\u2019s going to be a challenge for the ballroom dancers.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the score?\n\nOutsiders have a more basic, intrinsic question: Is breaking even a sport?\n\nLike most from his generation, 36-year-old Antonio Castillo didn\u2019t grow up thinking in those terms. Looking for a place to train, he opened a studio in Northwest Washington in 2011, eventually growing it into a fully fledged breaking school and taking on students.\n\n\u201cThe kids and parents were always interested in the battles; they were attracted to that idea of winning,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t hard to see where this was heading, because I was seeing it every day at the school.\u201d\n\nA breaking competition generally involves a series of dance battles. The dancers don\u2019t know the music ahead of time and have to improvise on the spot. Judges score them based on personality, technique, variety, creativity, performance and musicality.\n\nIn that sense, breaking isn\u2019t that different from other judged events at the Olympics, such as figure skating and gymnastics. Many incorporate music, costumes, acrobatics, strength and athleticism.\n\n\u201cBreaking is such a physically demanding dance,\u201d Rivas said. \u201cIt\u2019s so different than all the other dances and requires so much strength, energy, creativity, artistry.\u201d\n\nThe corporate world \u2014 think Red Bull and Monster Energy \u2014 have embraced breaking, and many think the Olympic stage is going to open many more doors for everyone involved. Castillo said he already has seen a bump in inquiries from young people for his studio.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6PU2QXDBZEI6XILXO5S7FGUVEQ.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.999355673789978}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The story of breaking \u2019s meteoric rise to the Olympic stage \u2014 it \u2019s set to make its debut at the Paris Summer Games in 2024 \u2014 involved an unlikely and reluctant partnership between street - savvy breakers and traditional ballroom dancers , an evolution of an urban art form into a competitive endeavor and a lightning - fast education campaign to sell Olympic officials and a curious sporting public that breakers are very much athletes. \n\n AD \n\n AD \n\n Born in the South Bronx nearly 50 years ago , breaking long ago had spread across the world and become far more nuanced than what was commercialized by 1980s pop culture and mass media."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "14d396c6-15bf-41cd-8f2d-015e2f125d46", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "Inside the play: The Bucs\u2019 interception of Patrick Mahomes that helped seal their Super Bowl win", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/02/08/inside-bucs-interception-patrick-mahomes/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_sports", "description": "Tampa Bay's defense was successful in stifling Kansas City's offense all game.", "published": "Mon, 08 Feb 2021 11:32:45 EST", "body": "The real Super Bowl MVP was Todd Bowles. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2019 defensive coordinator clamped down on the league\u2019s most explosive offense Sunday night with a devilishly simple scheme and by exploiting the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 weakness on the edges of their offensive line. The Bucs\u2019 defensive dominance in the 31-9 victory was on display during the team\u2019s interception late in the third quarter that helped seal the championship.\n\nBefore the snap, CBS color commentator Tony Romo understood the magnitude of the situation. He noted that 25-year-old Patrick Mahomes, the best quarterback of his era, \u201chas been Superman throughout his entire career,\u201d and the team needed him to put on his cape again. But the Bucs\u2019 defense in general, and rookie safety Antoine Winfield Jr. in particular, had a different idea.\n\nHere\u2019s how the play broke down.\n\nThe situation\n\nThe Bucs led the Chiefs 28-9 with 6:31 left in the third quarter. They faced third and 13 from their 22-yard line, a harrowing scenario for any offense. In a score-neutral situation, Kansas City might have run or thrown a short pass and then punted for better field position. But trailing by three scores and with time running low in the Super Bowl, Coach Andy Reid was dialing up his best play.\n\nBucs\u2019 interception 3rd qtr - 6:31 1st qtr 2nd qtr 3rd qtr 4th qtr Score Chiefs Bucs 3-0 14-6 21-9 7-3 14-3 21-6 28-9 31-9 Bucs\u2019 interception 3rd qtr - 6:31 1st qtr 2nd qtr 3rd qtr 4th qtr 3-0 Score Chiefs Bucs 14-6 21-9 7-3 14-3 21-6 28-9 31-9 Bucs\u2019 interception 3rd qtr - 6:31 1st qtr 2nd qtr 3rd qtr 4th qtr Score 3-0 7-3 14-3 14-6 21-6 21-9 28-9 Chiefs Bucs Bucs\u2019 interception 3rd qtr - 6:31 1st quarter 2nd quarter 3rd quarter 4th quarter Score 3-0 7-3 14-3 14-6 21-6 21-9 28-9 31-9 Chiefs Bucs Bucs\u2019 interception 3rd qtr - 6:31 1st quarter 2nd quarter 3rd quarter 4th quarter Score 3-0 7-3 14-3 14-6 21-6 21-9 28-9 31-9 Chiefs Bucs\n\nPresnap\n\nKansas City lined up in \u201c11\u201d personnel \u2014 three wide receivers, one tight end and one running back. Tampa Bay countered with a variant of its dime coverage \u2014 one down lineman at nose tackle, four linebackers on the line of scrimmage and six defensive backs. Because it was third and 13, the Bucs aligned five of those defensive backs within a few yards of the first-down line.\n\nS CB WR WR CB RB Barrett - LB TE S David - LB Suh - DL CB White - LB WR S Pierre-Paul - LB S CB WR WR CB RB Barrett - LB TE S David - LB Suh - DL CB White - LB WR S Pierre-Paul - LB S WR WR CB CB RB TE Barrett - LB S David - LB Suh - DL CB White - LB WR S Pierre-Paul - LB S WR WR CB CB RB TE Barrett - LB S David - LB Suh - DL CB White - LB WR S Pierre-Paul - LB Edwards - S WR WR Murphy-Bunting - CB RB Dean - CB Barrett - LB TE Winfield - S David - LB Suh - DL Whitehead - S White - LB WR Davis - CB Pierre-Paul - LB\n\nThe decision to replace two linemen with two linebackers in dime masked the Bucs\u2019 intentions. They could drop any of them into coverage or blitz with extra speed. But even though Bowles is known for his exotic blitzes, he hadn\u2019t sent many to this point. He hadn\u2019t needed to. The Chiefs were missing left tackle Eric Fisher (torn Achilles\u2019 tendon) and right tackle Mitchell Schwartz (back), and their replacements, Mike Remmers and Andrew Wylie, had shown little ability to slow Tampa Bay\u2019s pass rushers.\n\nBarrett Remmers - LT Wylie - RT Pierre-Paul Barrett Remmers - LT Wylie - RT Pierre-Paul Barrett Remmers - LT Wylie - RT Pierre-Paul Barrett Remmers - LT Wylie - RT Pierre-Paul Barrett Remmers - LT Wylie - RT Pierre-Paul\n\nThe ability to create pressure with four linemen was key. The two premier edge rushers, Shaq Barrett and Jason Pierre-Paul, wreaked havoc up front and allowed Bowles to devote more players to coverage. By the end of the game, Bowles had blitzed on 9.6 percent of dropbacks, his lowest rate in the past five years, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. The four-man rush generated 16 pressures.\n\nRomo, sensing the Chiefs\u2019 waning chances, said, \u201cIt\u2019s like now or never.\u201d\n\n[What went wrong for the Chiefs and Patrick Mahomes in a brutal Super Bowl defeat]\n\nPostsnap\n\nAfter Mahomes received the snap, two things became clear. One, the Bucs were sending a rare, five-man blitz, and two, the Chiefs didn\u2019t trust their line. The Chiefs devoted a running back to pass protection and asked the lone receiver on the right side, Demarcus Robinson, to chip. They sent three targets deep: tight end Travis Kelce and wide receivers Tyreek Hill and Sammy Watkins.\n\nWatkins 1 Mahomes Hill 2 3 Kelce 4 5 Watkins 1 Mahomes Hill 2 3 Kelce 4 5 Watkins 1 Mahomes Hill 2 3 4 Kelce 5 Watkins 1 Mahomes Hill 2 3 4 Kelce 5 Watkins 1 Hill Mahomes 2 3 4 Kelce 5\n\nDespite the extra protection, Tampa Bay was able to create pressure. Bucs linebacker Lavonte David and defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh shed their blockers and zeroed in on Mahomes. The Chiefs quarterback started to drift right, moving as he had to all night \u2014 he traveled 497 yards before throwing the ball or being sacked Sunday, the most scramble yards in a game by any quarterback since Next Gen Stats began tracking the metric in 2016.\n\nThe distance traveled quantifies how the Bucs\u2019 four-man pass rush affected Mahomes. He was pressured on 29 of his 56 dropbacks, most of any quarterback in Super Bowl history.\n\nMahomes David Suh Mahomes David Suh Mahomes David Suh Mahomes David Suh David Mahomes Suh\n\nThe throw\n\nAs he rolled out, Mahomes spotted Hill streaking right across the field. He looked to be in single coverage against Bucs backup safety Mike Edwards. Hill had been quiet so far, but since Mahomes became the starter in 2018, Hill has been one of his most trusted targets \u2014 and together they had burned the Bucs in their previous meeting for 13 catches, 269 yards and three touchdowns. Mahomes let the pass fly.\n\nReverse angle 40 yards Hill Mahomes Reverse angle 40 yards Hill Mahomes Reverse angle 40 yards Hill Mahomes Reverse angle 40 yards Hill Mahomes Reverse angle 40 yards Mahomes Hill\n\nThe ball looked quintessential Mahomes at first, off his back foot but perfectly placed, whizzing over the outstretched hand of cornerback Carlton Davis.\n\nThe interception\n\nThe Bucs often played two deep safeties to prevent the Chiefs from hitting the explosive plays that make their offense so dangerous. But even when Mahomes tried short passes to Kelce, his trusted tight end, a linebacker often stretched out a hand to tip it away. The elite coverage appeared again on this play as Edwards played perfect leverage and stuck his hand in front of Hill.\n\nEdwards Hill Winfield Winfield Edwards Hill Winfield Winfield Edwards Hill Winfield Winfield Edwards Winfield Hill Winfield Edwards Winfield Hill Winfield\n\nThe ball caromed off Edwards\u2019s hand and bounced backward into the waiting arms of Winfield. Everything that led to the interception \u2014 pressure with four, excellent coverage, surprising schematic wrinkles \u2014 illustrated why the Bucs\u2019 defense had succeeded throughout the game. The pick itself all but sealed their title.\n\nImages from NFL Game Pass and CBS.\n\nPhotoillustration using an original photo by David J.

The top four assist leaders are too, prompting a look into why Canadian teams are surging offensively. Have the top scorers gotten better, or, in a season when teams only play against divisional opponents, has the goaltending and defense on Canada-based teams just gotten worse? The early returns suggest the defense and goaltending from the division\u2019s teams has declined.\n\nCalgary\u2019s Mark Giordano, the 2019 Norris Trophy winner, and Rasmus Andersson allow 2.5 expected goals per 60 minutes at even strength, which means that based on the shot quality of each attempt we would expect that many goals to be scored per 60 minutes of ice time. They allowed 2.0 expected goals per 60 minutes last season. Only seven other defensive pairs skating at least 100 minutes together have been worse this season. Three of those are also in the North division.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdmonton\u2019s Darnell Nurse and Tyson Barrie allow the highest rate of even-strength shots against per 60 minutes among all defensive duos sharing at least 100 minutes of ice time together. They are also on the ice for the highest expected goals against per 60 minutes, meaning they allow a very high quality of shot. Vancouver\u2019s Jordie Benn and Quinn Hughes are the second-worst defensive pair in regard to shot quality allowed. The Canucks\u2019 Nate Schmidt and Tyler Myers allow the third-highest rate of shots against after adjusting for shot quality, and the Oilers\u2019 Nurse and Ethan Bear rank as the fifth-worst.\n\nAs a division, the North allows an expected goals against rate, which takes into account shot volume and shot quality, of 2.9 per 60 minutes at all strengths, the worst among the realigned divisions. Half of the 10 worst-performing teams \u2014Vancouver (31st), the Ottawa Senators (28th), Toronto (27th), Edmonton (23rd) and the Winnipeg Jets (22nd) \u2014 play in the North division.\n\nA higher quality of shot doesn\u2019t do any favors for the netminders, but the goalies aren\u2019t helping themselves, either. Ottawa\u2019s Marcus Hogberg is, statistically, the worst netminder in the league. He\u2019s stopped 122 of 146 shots faced in six games for a league-low .836 save percentage compared to a .902 save percentage we\u2019d expect based on shot quality. That makes him worth 10 goals below the performance we\u2019d expect from an average netminder. Surprisingly, Vancouver\u2019s Braden Holtby, a former Vezina Trophy winner and Stanley Cup champion with the Washington Capitals, is also at the bottom of the list. Holtby has stopped 231 of 261 shots faced over eight games, giving him a below-average .885 save rate. Based on where the shots originated from, we would expect Holtby\u2019s save rate to be closer to .903. Edmonton\u2019s Mikko Koskinen, meanwhile, has allowed the most goals against this season (44) resulting in an .895 overall save percentage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMontreal splits the time in its net between Jake Allen and Carey Price. The former is holding his own (a .933 save percentage), but the latter is well below average (.896). Calgary\u2019s Jacob Markstrom is perhaps the only goaltender in the division who can be called a dependable starter this season. The 31-year-old has a .921 save rate and has stopped 96 percent of all even-strength scoring chances and 21 out of 22 attempts originating in the slot or the crease.\n\nStill, the North division, as a whole, has an .898 overall save percentage. Two teams in the division, Vancouver (.886, 28th) and Ottawa (.864, 31st), rank in the bottom five for save percentage. It\u2019s just hard to win with that level of goaltending. Since the lockout of 2005-06, only one team has won the Stanley Cup with a regular season save percentage under .900, the Carolina Hurricanes (2006).\n\n2020-21 NHL 2020-21 NHL Overall Sv% West Division West Division .904 Central Division Central Division .903 East Division East Division .900 North Division North Division .898", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V5C3JNJ7OFGE7ANOUECALBYPDI.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9973894953727722}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "So far this season , all of the top six goal scorers and eight of the top 10 are from the North.

He just made it even more real for me because I know I could do it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBurns, the top welterweight contender, has earned six straight wins.\n\nBut Usman hasn\u2019t lost since 2013. His 12 consecutive victories make for the longest active streak in the UFC, and another would push him into a six-way tie for the second-longest streak in the promotion\u2019s history.\n\nWoodley belittled Usman during the UFC 235 news conference, prompting Usman to say, \u201cYou can feel like the big brother all you want but at some point, big brother going to get they a-- whooped.\u201d He followed through, seizing the belt and casting Woodley into his current descent.\n\nUsman next fought Colby Covington, an outspoken supporter of Donald Trump who has often been criticized for his behavior. Covington, who began disparaging Usman months before their fight, assumed a more vitriolic tone than Woodley, provoking several confrontations, including one in the Palms Casino Resort buffet line the day after Usman defeated Woodley. Usman went on to crack Covington\u2019s jaw en route to a fifth-round victory by TKO in December 2019.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one thing that I\u2019ve been seeing lately is just kind of how people in the media and fans kind of perceive me,\u201d Usman said. \u201cJust because I\u2019m quiet, just because I\u2019m not the most braggadocios or boisterous guy out there, they kind of overlook me. They kind of take it as a weakness to where that\u2019s not the case at all.\u201d\n\nUsman was slated to face Burns at July\u2019s UFC 251, but Burns tested positive for the coronavirus just over a week before they were scheduled to fight. Jorge Masvidal, who had exchanged words with Usman ahead of Super Bowl LIV in Miami, took the title fight on short notice.\n\n\u201cWhen the Max Holloway fight was over and I saw Masvidal walking in instead of me, that hurt me a lot,\u201d Burns said in reference to the UFC 251 co-main event. \u201cThat was like man, that\u2019s supposed to be me there right now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe lead-up to this weekend\u2019s event has been far less contentious for Usman, who split from his former teammates to train in Denver last summer for the original matchup against Burns. He said he did so to secure more personalized attention during his pre-fight camp.\n\n\u201cHe can say, \u2018I beat him a couple rounds,\u2019 but I say, \u2018Yeah, but I beat you couple rounds too,\u2019 so it's kind of very even the advantage that we have knowing each other's game,\u201d Burns said of his history with Usman. \u201cThe thing that I believe I got the advantage is the teammates because he left the team, and all the teammates that helped me get prepared for him know him very well.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EHQQZDAHIZEQ3FB5IC6W4TGQNY.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9459511637687683}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "AD \n\n AD \n\n Burns , the top welterweight contender , has earned six straight wins. \n\n He and Burns fought for the now - defunct Blackzilians , a team of professional fighters based in South Florida , starting in 2011."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "e0220132-840f-4040-97f4-fa53f63e1d1e", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "NHL adds game-day rapid testing to coronavirus protocols", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/02/11/nhl-covid-19-coronavirus-protocols/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_sports", "description": "The league, which has already postponed 35 games and has nearly 50 players on its covid list, also adds further testing requirements and recommends all team personnel be provided KN95 masks.", "published": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 09:17:26 EST", "body": "\u201cAlthough these [rapid] tests have a slightly lower ability to detect the presence of COVID-19 than lab-based PCR testing, they will provide prompt, same-day results that will reduce the chance of game participation by individuals who might have active infection,\u201d the league said in a statement, which also noted it is seeking similar testing for Canadian teams.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs of Thursday, 49 players from eight teams were on the covid-19 protocols list. Players can end up on the list because of positive tests, symptoms, contact tracing or travel quarantines.\n\nOther measures include better access to testing for family or household members of players. The NHL will also now be analyzing clusters of positive test samples with whole genomic sequencing to determine specific coronavirus strains.\n\nThe new measures come a week after other new protocols were announced, including removing the glass from behind the benches to help with air flow. The league\u2019s Thursday announcement went a step further to that end with the removal of the plexiglass from behind the penalty box.\n\nThere are currently two teams on pause because of the virus: the Philadelphia Flyers and the New Jersey Devils. The Buffalo Sabres were shut down for a week, but they reopened their practice facility Tuesday. The Colorado Avalanche also reopened their facilities Thursday after a week hiatus. The Minnesota Wild, on pause for the past week, announced Thursday that it will reopen for team activities Friday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther measures announced Thursday by the league include the recommendation that teams provide all team personnel with KN95 masks. Previously, there was no specific requirement of what type of mask should be worn. Most players have been wearing a type of medical mask or league-approved facial covering. Players and coaches must wear masks off the ice. Coaches are still required to wear them during games and on the ice for practices.\n\nThe league is also requiring all team-related meetings to be held virtually. This will include coaches\u2019 meetings and video sessions. In addition, the league is seeking to limit social interactions for teams on the road. While players are not allowed to socialize in each other\u2019s hotel rooms, they are still allowed to mingle in team-approved social lounges. These lounges are now required to close at midnight.\n\nTeams have also been reminded that all team personnel will be required to \u201cremain at home and not leave their place of residence except to attend practices and games, to exercise outdoors on an individual basis, to perform essential activities (e.g., go to the doctor), or to deal with family or other emergencies and other extraordinary circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe league\u2019s initial health and safety measures sent out before the season spanned 213 pages.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5DBFUHDFAQI6XOVYOB7YO2OXQU.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9717545509338379}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "AD \n\n AD \n\n As of Thursday , 49 players from eight teams were on the covid-19 protocols list. \n\n There are currently two teams on pause because of the virus : the Philadelphia Flyers and the New Jersey Devils."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "dc12caaa-2b9e-44cc-808d-a8fd153e0ecb", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "Trevor Bauer, unorthodox star with an unorthodox deal, gets an unorthodox Dodgers intro", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/02/11/dodgers-trevor-bauer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_sports", "description": "Trevor Bauer was introduced by the Dodgers on Thursday in a news conference that highlighted the uncertainty of what exactly the team is  paying for in the right-hander.", "published": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 07:32:11 EST", "body": "The scene was fitting, given that the shine of adding the reigning National League Cy Young Award winner to the defending World Series champions obscured the picture of exactly what the Dodgers are getting in the enigmatic right-hander.\n\nHis baseball credentials are unique among those afforded record-breaking contracts \u2014 and Bauer\u2019s $40 million salary for 2021, part of a three-year deal worth up to $102 million, makes him the highest-paid player for a single season in baseball history.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBauer has been good for several years but excellent for two \u2014 a breakout 2018 that saw him post a 2.21 ERA over 175\u2153 innings and the shortened 2020 in which he pitched to a 1.73 ERA, striking out 100 in 73 innings. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 gleams with durability. But it does not mirror Clayton Kershaw\u2019s, which includes three Cy Young awards, three World Series trips and eight all-star appearances.\n\nOff the field, Bauer has been polarizing. In a sport that values being one of 26, in which no one in a clubhouse puts himself above the others, the outspoken Bauer is active on social media, speaks openly of his brand, sells merchandise on his website and referenced his \u201cvlog\u201d in his introductory news conference. He reiterated Thursday what he said many times all winter \u2014 that he sought a team that would be willing to start \u201ca partnership\u201d with him that would let him be himself.\n\nThose habits run the risk of ruffling feathers in any clubhouse, let alone a World Series champion group loaded with veterans. But so far, most of Bauer\u2019s critics have been found online.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBauer has pestered women who challenge him on Twitter, a habit made more noticeable by the fact that he has not handled male critics on the platform so pointedly. In one such 2019 diatribe, Bauer made a comment that disparaged and discredited trans and nonbinary people.\n\nShortly after, he issued a statement discouraging similar harassment and promising to do better. A few weeks ago, a New York Daily News reporter tweeted that she received death threats and Holocaust jokes after Bauer attacked her on the platform in 2020.\n\n\u201cEveryone makes mistakes in the past. I try to learn from them,\u201d Bauer said in answer to one of several questions he got about his social media behavior. None of those answers included the word \u201csorry.\u201d When asked directly whether he would stop fighting back on social media, Bauer dodged and reiterated his commitment to \u201chaving a positive impact on the community.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI try to understand other people\u2019s viewpoints on things and be better in the future. I think if you look at my history as a baseball player, my history on social media, my history as a person, those who know me well will see I apply that process to everything that I do,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cI\u2019m committed to doing that moving forward as well.\u201d\n\nFriedman said Dodgers officials did their research on Bauer and even spoke to him about those issues. He said he hopes that he and his staff have built up \u201csome trust and credibility\u201d in terms of their vetting of players. Friedman said the Dodgers talked to clubhouse staff, trainers and especially teammates.\n\n\u201cThere was some stuff that was more public with Trevor that we definitely wanted to dig into. We had multiple conversations with Trevor. Stan [Kasten] and I talked to Trevor,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cAnd the most important thing is every teammate we talked to, all the feedback we got from every organization he was with was not only incredibly positive about the type of teammate he is but also in terms of the impact he makes on each organization.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFriedman said the Dodgers had targeted Bauer, a Southern California native, all offseason. He admitted that a week ago, when reports circulated suggesting Bauer was headed to the New York Mets, he went to bed \u201cpretty bummed.\u201d\n\nOn Friday morning, the Dodgers changed their offer in a way that made Bauer rethink things. He called to receive financial advice on tax implications, then had a chat with his father. Soon after, Bauer released a video saying he was a Dodger.\n\nWhile many veteran pitchers seek long-term security in their big free agent deals \u2014 and with security expected to loom even larger because of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 Bauer chose a three-year deal with two opt-outs and record annual value for the first two years. He insisted the decision was about flexibility, not money.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI want a chance to win, and I don\u2019t want to be a player who signs a long-term deal and then is resented, either by the fan base or the organization or on my end for having my performance slip below what my contract dictates,\u201d Bauer said.\n\nIf Bauer pitches to the level his contract dictates, even for just one year, the Dodgers are clear favorites to repeat as World Series champions. Friedman said one concern he had coming into 2021 was not the talent on the pitching staff but the depth \u2014 after a shortened season, would starting pitchers struggle to carry more than double the load they did last year?\n\nIn Bauer, Friedman saw depth and durability \u2014 and a player quick to adjust. He is a voracious consumer of analytics, one of the game\u2019s most prominent stories about how a commitment to data can help an already solid player emerge as a star. Bauer said he chose the Dodgers in part because of the way they interpret data, not merely that they use it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut many things about Bauer, from his two-agent tag team to his self-produced decision video, are different. And his experience with the Dodgers may end up that way, too.\n\nA day before he was officially introduced, Bauer tweeted about his excitement to meet Dodgers fans but also his desire that they \u201chave some respect for my personal space when I\u2019m at my house or hotel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not ok to follow me through the hotel demanding that I sign,\u201d he wrote, before explaining in his news conference that the message was prompted by an encounter with one particularly dogged fan in his Los Angeles hotel. Bauer has never played professionally in a market such as Los Angeles before, never played in a clubhouse as established and accomplished as that of the Dodgers.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WCB5PEPWGZEOXNFG7ZA7GDA47Q.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9051353931427002}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Off the field , Bauer has been polarizing.

The top four assist leaders are too, prompting a look into why Canadian teams are surging offensively. Have the top scorers gotten better, or, in a season when teams only play against divisional opponents, has the goaltending and defense on Canada-based teams just gotten worse? The early returns suggest the defense and goaltending from the division\u2019s teams has declined.\n\nCalgary\u2019s Mark Giordano, the 2019 Norris Trophy winner, and Rasmus Andersson allow 2.5 expected goals per 60 minutes at even strength, which means that based on the shot quality of each attempt we would expect that many goals to be scored per 60 minutes of ice time. They allowed 2.0 expected goals per 60 minutes last season. Only seven other defensive pairs skating at least 100 minutes together have been worse this season. Three of those are also in the North division.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdmonton\u2019s Darnell Nurse and Tyson Barrie allow the highest rate of even-strength shots against per 60 minutes among all defensive duos sharing at least 100 minutes of ice time together. They are also on the ice for the highest expected goals against per 60 minutes, meaning they allow a very high quality of shot. Vancouver\u2019s Jordie Benn and Quinn Hughes are the second-worst defensive pair in regard to shot quality allowed. The Canucks\u2019 Nate Schmidt and Tyler Myers allow the third-highest rate of shots against after adjusting for shot quality, and the Oilers\u2019 Nurse and Ethan Bear rank as the fifth-worst.\n\nAs a division, the North allows an expected goals against rate, which takes into account shot volume and shot quality, of 2.9 per 60 minutes at all strengths, the worst among the realigned divisions. Half of the 10 worst-performing teams \u2014Vancouver (31st), the Ottawa Senators (28th), Toronto (27th), Edmonton (23rd) and the Winnipeg Jets (22nd) \u2014 play in the North division.\n\nA higher quality of shot doesn\u2019t do any favors for the netminders, but the goalies aren\u2019t helping themselves, either. Ottawa\u2019s Marcus Hogberg is, statistically, the worst netminder in the league. He\u2019s stopped 122 of 146 shots faced in six games for a league-low .836 save percentage compared to a .902 save percentage we\u2019d expect based on shot quality. That makes him worth 10 goals below the performance we\u2019d expect from an average netminder. Surprisingly, Vancouver\u2019s Braden Holtby, a former Vezina Trophy winner and Stanley Cup champion with the Washington Capitals, is also at the bottom of the list. Holtby has stopped 231 of 261 shots faced over eight games, giving him a below-average .885 save rate. Based on where the shots originated from, we would expect Holtby\u2019s save rate to be closer to .903. Edmonton\u2019s Mikko Koskinen, meanwhile, has allowed the most goals against this season (44) resulting in an .895 overall save percentage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMontreal splits the time in its net between Jake Allen and Carey Price. The former is holding his own (a .933 save percentage), but the latter is well below average (.896). Calgary\u2019s Jacob Markstrom is perhaps the only goaltender in the division who can be called a dependable starter this season. The 31-year-old has a .921 save rate and has stopped 96 percent of all even-strength scoring chances and 21 out of 22 attempts originating in the slot or the crease.\n\nStill, the North division, as a whole, has an .898 overall save percentage. Two teams in the division, Vancouver (.886, 28th) and Ottawa (.864, 31st), rank in the bottom five for save percentage. It\u2019s just hard to win with that level of goaltending. Since the lockout of 2005-06, only one team has won the Stanley Cup with a regular season save percentage under .900, the Carolina Hurricanes (2006).\n\n2020-21 NHL 2020-21 NHL Overall Sv% West Division West Division .904 Central Division Central Division .903 East Division East Division .900 North Division North Division .898", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V5C3JNJ7OFGE7ANOUECALBYPDI.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9973894953727722}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "So far this season , all of the top six goal scorers and eight of the top 10 are from the North.

Newman finished in ninth place. Viewers and fans held their breath as the crash was replayed over and over. With no memory of that, Newman is ready for this year\u2019s race.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever been in a car accident or you know somebody that has been in a car accident and they were conscious the whole time, they will always carry that fear with them,\u201d Newman told reporters on Media Day earlier this month. \u201cI have no memory, so therefore I have no fear.\u201d\n\nThe 43-year-old driver managed to finish ahead of Michael Jordan, who was second on Google\u2019s list thanks to \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d documentary series.

It doesn\u2019t change my personal memory because it just doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nNewman spent two days in Halifax Medical Center, with an absence of updates fueling fears about his injuries. But two days later, he walked out of the hospital \u2014 shoeless and clutching the hands of his two daughter \u2014 and headed for the track to hang out with Martin Truex Jr., a close friend. He\u2019d suffered a brain bruise in the crash, he said later.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI really can\u2019t remember the first thing he said,\u201d his father, Greg, told the Charlotte Observer of the hospitalization, \u201cbut I remember the second or third thing I said was, \u2018Do you want a Krispy Kreme doughnut?\u2019 and he shook his head yeah. So I had to go get him some Krispy Kremes.\u201d\n\nPartly because of the coronavirus pandemic, Newman missed only three races and by August, he was driving in the Go Bowling 235 in a return to Daytona International Speedway. He may not remember his crash, but he is aware of how fortunate he was. \u201cIt was special in more ways than one to come back in through the tunnel, get back inside the racetrack,\u201d Newman said on the \u201cToday\u201d show at the time.\n\nHe had a message for fans that day. \u201cHey, everyone, just want to say a big thank you,\u201d he said over the car radio before that race. \u201cThis is a special day for me, a lot of it because of all the things that you guys did back in February. \u2026 Thank you for your support, not only for me personally, but all of the things that you do for all of us drivers. It goes a long way, and I wanted to say thank you from the deepest of my heart. Thank you.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat may have been the best indication that he recognized what he had gone through.

The mangled No. 6 Ford sits in a shop on his farm near Statesville, N.C. \u201c... I tell people, how many chances do you have of a trophy of something that saved your life? And that\u2019s how I look at it,\u201d he explained to NBC Sports in November. \u201cThat almost cost me my life, but it\u2019s also the things that saved my life.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI look at it as the guys that welded the car together, the guys that bolted the seat in, my helmet. All the things that saved me that day, those are trophies in my mind. That\u2019s part of why it\u2019s there. It\u2019s educational for my kids, it\u2019s educational for me, it\u2019s educational for everyone in the garage area.

They began training together at Sanford MMA, a gym about 40 miles north of Miami, in 2017.\n\nDuring that time, Burns (19-3) learned Usman\u2019s tendencies. He also witnessed the Nigerian fighter (17-1) become the first African-born UFC champion when Usman defeated Woodley by unanimous decision after five rounds to win the welterweight belt at UFC 235.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Kamaru for a long time, since the very, very beginning,\u201d Burns said (via UFC). \u201cRight away we kind of liked to work with each other, and that was always a war. So when Kamaru became a world champion, that motivated me a lot. He just made it even more real for me because I know I could do it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBurns, the top welterweight contender, has earned six straight wins.\n\nBut Usman hasn\u2019t lost since 2013. His 12 consecutive victories make for the longest active streak in the UFC, and another would push him into a six-way tie for the second-longest streak in the promotion\u2019s history.\n\nWoodley belittled Usman during the UFC 235 news conference, prompting Usman to say, \u201cYou can feel like the big brother all you want but at some point, big brother going to get they a-- whooped.\u201d He followed through, seizing the belt and casting Woodley into his current descent.\n\nUsman next fought Colby Covington, an outspoken supporter of Donald Trump who has often been criticized for his behavior. Covington, who began disparaging Usman months before their fight, assumed a more vitriolic tone than Woodley, provoking several confrontations, including one in the Palms Casino Resort buffet line the day after Usman defeated Woodley. Usman went on to crack Covington\u2019s jaw en route to a fifth-round victory by TKO in December 2019.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one thing that I\u2019ve been seeing lately is just kind of how people in the media and fans kind of perceive me,\u201d Usman said. \u201cJust because I\u2019m quiet, just because I\u2019m not the most braggadocios or boisterous guy out there, they kind of overlook me. They kind of take it as a weakness to where that\u2019s not the case at all.\u201d\n\nUsman was slated to face Burns at July\u2019s UFC 251, but Burns tested positive for the coronavirus just over a week before they were scheduled to fight. Jorge Masvidal, who had exchanged words with Usman ahead of Super Bowl LIV in Miami, took the title fight on short notice.\n\n\u201cWhen the Max Holloway fight was over and I saw Masvidal walking in instead of me, that hurt me a lot,\u201d Burns said in reference to the UFC 251 co-main event. \u201cThat was like man, that\u2019s supposed to be me there right now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe lead-up to this weekend\u2019s event has been far less contentious for Usman, who split from his former teammates to train in Denver last summer for the original matchup against Burns. He said he did so to secure more personalized attention during his pre-fight camp.\n\n\u201cHe can say, \u2018I beat him a couple rounds,\u2019 but I say, \u2018Yeah, but I beat you couple rounds too,\u2019 so it's kind of very even the advantage that we have knowing each other's game,\u201d Burns said of his history with Usman. \u201cThe thing that I believe I got the advantage is the teammates because he left the team, and all the teammates that helped me get prepared for him know him very well.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EHQQZDAHIZEQ3FB5IC6W4TGQNY.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9459511637687683}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "AD \n\n AD \n\n Burns , the top welterweight contender , has earned six straight wins. \n\n He and Burns fought for the now - defunct Blackzilians , a team of professional fighters based in South Florida , starting in 2011."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "5adfeaf9-39da-4bd9-89b4-e3d316af4bda", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "TV and radio listings: February 25", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/tv-and-radio-listings-february-25/2019/02/25/73603dd4-38ba-11e9-a06c-3ec8ed509d15_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_sports", "description": "Your guide to the world of sports on television and radio.", "published": "Mon, 25 Feb 2019 12:05:03 EST", "body": "Today\u2019s Headlines\n\nThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OG4XBBBWHQI6TA3V4POPNNUFLA.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.991688072681427}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Today \u2019s Headlines \n\n The most important news stories of the day , curated by Post editors and delivered every morning. \n\n By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "0287417e-5469-4d30-a006-7620dcb88ed8", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "Doug Williams, under pressure of history, had a Super Bowl that still ranks among the best", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/02/05/doug-williams-super-bowl/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_sports", "description": "Doug Williams responded to the intense scrutiny of being the first Black quarterback to start in the Super Bowl with a superb game, throwing four touchdown passes in a rout of the Broncos.", "published": "Fri, 05 Feb 2021 11:33:02 EST", "body": "\u201cMaybe the most significant quarterback performance in Super Bowl history still comes down to Doug Williams,\u201d NFL historian Joe Horrigan, a former executive director at the Pro Football Hall of Fame, said in a phone interview last week. \u201cBecause Doug wasn\u2019t competing just against John Elway; Doug was competing against every quarterback who ever played the game. That was huge.\u201d\n\nIn the days leading up to Super Bowl XXII, Williams, who on Thursday was appointed to a new role in the Washington Football Team\u2019s front office as senior adviser to team president Jason Wright, was the focus of attention.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe questions put to Williams from 1,000 or so national media members this week were either pointed enough, probing enough, insensitive enough or just silly enough to make a lesser man run back to his room and hide,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Michael Wilbon wrote from the middle of the media circus in 1988. \u201c\u2026 Of course, everybody\u2019s favorite has to be, \u201cDoug, you\u2019ve been a Black quarterback all your life \u2026\u201d\n\nWilliams expected the questions and didn\u2019t take offense, but he was more concerned with Broncos linebacker Karl Mecklenburg than his place in history at the time.\n\n\u201cAll of the emphasis was put on myself being Black and the history part of it and everything, and I understood the significance of being the first to play in the Super Bowl, but I couldn\u2019t go into the game looking at it from that standpoint,\u201d Williams said this week on the Washington Football Team\u2019s Women of Washington podcast. \u201cI had to go and prepare from a standpoint of finding a way to win the game. I always said that when the game was over and we won, you can paint me any color you want to, but I still was the starting quarterback of the Washington Redskins.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know he dismisses it a little bit today and says it wasn\u2019t on his mind as much as people might think, but I know Doug well,\u201d said Horrigan, who consulted with Williams and fellow trailblazing Black quarterback James \u201cShack\u201d Harris when they co-founded the Black College Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. \u201cI think it\u2019s baloney. It was on his mind. He had so many burdens on his back that day and responded in such a profound way that changed not just that Super Bowl, but it changed the game. He had a lot to prove. There couldn\u2019t have been a more challenging game than that, and he won in such unbelievable fashion.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter being knocked out of the game for one series after straining his knee in the first quarter, Williams, who underwent a four-hour root canal the day before, returned and led the greatest single-quarter offensive explosion in Super Bowl history. The former Grambling star completed 9 of 11 passes for 228 yards and four touchdowns in Washington\u2019s 35-point second quarter, which turned a 10-0 deficit into a rout. The outburst began with an 80-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Ricky Sanders and ended with an eight-yard scoring grab by tight end Clint Didier. Williams finished 18 of 29 for 340 yards, four touchdowns and one interception, earning MVP honors.\n\nSo why does Super Bowl XXII, despite Williams\u2019s historic performance opposite a Hall of Famer in Elway, land in the bottom half of our Super Bowl QB matchup rankings? The answer is in the methodology, which relied on three statistical elements. The first assessed the quality of the quarterbacks\u2019 careers. The second measured how well they played in the season leading up to their Super Bowl meeting. Finally, the quarterbacks\u2019 performance in the big game was considered. Williams was a solid but not exceptional player in the years before and after his only Super Bowl appearance, and he started only two games during the 1987 regular season, so he rates poorly on two of the three elements.\n\nWilliams\u2019s performance in the Super Bowl, however, was among the best ever. His quarterback game score, a modification to baseball statistician Bill James\u2019s formula used for pitchers, was 68. That\u2019s the fourth highest in Super Bowl history behind only the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 Steve Young and Joe Montana, who posted game scores of 71 in 1994 and 1989, and the New England Patriots\u2019 Tom Brady (69) in 2017.\n\n\u201cAs the first Black quarterback in the NFL championship game,\u201d The Post\u2019s Ken Denlinger wrote after Washington\u2019s 42-10 win, Williams \u201cwas under even more scrutiny this week than Elway. He handled that with grace and patience, and then performed as brilliantly as any of his most ardent admirers could have hoped.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NPELC7BOXFC5JNCWFJ2EMAOOZQ.png&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9996758103370667}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "\u201c Maybe the most significant quarterback performance in Super Bowl history still comes down to Doug Williams , \u201d NFL historian Joe Horrigan , a former executive director at the Pro Football Hall of Fame , said in a phone interview last week \u201c.

Russell, a former Washington Football Team beat reporter for both WJFK and WTEM who has appeared on both stations since 2009, has been the interim afternoon drive host at 980 since Steve Czaban announced in December that he was leaving his weekday role to host a Saturday morning show on 106.7.\n\nAfter Entercom acquired WTEM in November, there was some uncertainty about the future of D.C.'s first all-sports radio station, which launched in May 1992. WTEM program director Chris Johnson and hosts Rick \u201cDoc\u201d Walker and Scott Linn were laid off two weeks after the acquisition was announced.

I\u2019m just so grateful for it, and I\u2019m now ready to move on to the next chapter.\u201d\n\nBut before he did, Doolittle and the Nationals discussed a reunion that never got too close to happening. In his retelling, the Nationals reached out at the start of free agency \u2014 some time in November \u2014 and expressed interest in bringing him back. Doolittle described himself as \u201cattached to the Nats\u201d in a way he shouldn\u2019t have been. He wanted to make it work, he said, and stay with the coaches, teammates and staffers he won the World Series with in 2019. He\u2019s from New Jersey and spends most winters in Chicago yet considered Washington his quasi-home.\n\nAs the winter wore on, though, Doolittle shifted away from that aspiration. Talks with the Nationals seeped into the new year. The sides even tentatively negotiated terms and money. Then the Nationals signed left-handed reliever Brad Hand to a one-year, $10.5 million deal on Jan. 24. Doolittle saw the \u201cwriting on the wall,\u201d as he put it, and started to consider other options with more urgency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Reds were the first team to reach out in early November. Two members of their organization happened to work at the facility Doolittle trained at this offseason in Tempe, Ariz. Doolittle picked their brains on the culture, the pitching development and personalities in the clubhouse. He spoke with Reds pitching coach Derek Johnson and starter Sonny Gray, his friend from when they played together in Oakland. And that led him to Cincinnati over a few other offers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no hard feelings here,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at the Nats. I could never be mad at the Nats. Are you kidding me? There\u2019s a business side of this, and right out of the gate, we had financial discussions with other teams that was just better. It happens, and that\u2019s okay.\n\n\u201cBut I knew I wasn\u2019t going to break the bank in free agency, you know what I mean? The money wasn\u2019t the driving factor. I wanted to be somewhere where I felt like I could continue all the work that I\u2019ve been doing since last summer, and the Nats were definitely on the shortlist of that. It just never really felt like it was going to come together.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLast summer, Doolittle landed at the Nationals\u2019 alternate site after yielding seven hits, three homers and five earned runs in five appearances. His fastball lacked life and velocity. He had bleak thoughts about his arm being permanently spent.\n\nHe had technically gone to the injured list with right knee fatigue. The idea was to give him a breather in Fredericksburg, Va., a chance to smooth out his mechanics and get on track. When he returned to Washington, he appeared closer to his usual self. But then he strained his right oblique Sept. 10 and was finished for the season.\n\nHealth and safety protocols kept him from passing through the ballpark to say goodbye, whether it was for the winter or for good. He instead wrote a letter to each staffer \u2014 from the clubhouse attendants to the video team \u2014 and dropped them off in the parking lot while gathering his stuff. The ending felt entirely incomplete.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to wear out my welcome somewhere,\u201d Doolittle said with a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m about to play my 10th season and had never had a say in where I played until now. And part of me thought, if I\u2019m back in Washington, am I trying to exorcise some demons from 2020 and 2019? Am I trying to rewrite a narrative about myself? I got into the idea of having a clean slate.\u201d\n\nDoolittle spent a month rehabbing the oblique injury with the Nationals\u2019 physical therapist. After that, he and his wife, Eireann Dolan, traveled to Scottsdale. He was throwing by the first week of November. In the months since, he has worked with high-tech cameras and programs to tweak his delivery and workshop pitches. He trained with weighted balls for the first time. He is learning what data is useful for him. He has learned a lot.\n\nAnd the Reds, Doolittle noted, are known for cutting-edge pitching practices. Kyle Boddy, Cincinnati\u2019s director of pitching, founded Driveline, a popular workout facility. Nate Irving, the Reds\u2019 bullpen catcher, was one of Doolittle\u2019s instructors this winter. The opportunity to build on what began in Fredericksburg and carried to Tempe was alluring to Doolittle. He feels ready to keep remaking himself.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PUAM22GEBVFP5DHMOWGG6BU3OA.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9990699887275696}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "AD \n\n AD \n\n The Reds were the first team to reach out in early November.

He signed there for $2.5 million and had a $3 million vesting option for 2021. But by returning to the United States and to his most recent MLB team, Parra will attempt to make the 26-man roster out of spring training. Washington needs one more reserve and could use a lefty for pinch-hit situations. But the Nationals still would have to add Parra to their 40-man roster before activating him. They are at 39 players and could keep the last spot empty for roster flexibility.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Japan, Parra hit .267 with a .305 on-base percentage and a .384 slugging percentage in 47 games with the Giants\u2019 top team. He made eight other appearances in the minors. From that limited sample, Parra isn\u2019t a great fit for the Nationals\u2019 remaining bench spot. The other four will be filled by catcher Alex Avila, first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, utility man Josh Harrison and outfielder Andrew Stevenson. Harrison, another veteran, can play second, third, left and right. Stevenson, 26, projects to be the club\u2019s fourth outfielder.\n\nThat leaves little room for Parra \u2014 aside from the obvious ways he improved team chemistry two years ago. There is a loose argument for adding another left-handed bat to the bench (whether that is Parra or another player in the organization). But there\u2019s a good argument for the Nationals to address that through free agency before camp.\n\nAvila hits left-handed. But as the backup catcher, he is unlikely to pinch-hit unless its an emergency. Stevenson, also a left-handed hitter, could often be saved as a late-inning defensive replacement for Kyle Schwarber. And then there\u2019s Luis Garc\u00eda, the 20-year-old infielder who slashed .276/.302/.366 from the left side in 139 plate appearances in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet the Nationals\u2019 general philosophy is to keep top prospects in the minors unless they can play every day. So if Carter Kieboom is their third baseman and veteran Starlin Castro starts at second, that theory would squeeze Garc\u00eda out of the regular lineup and land him with the Class AAA Rochester Red Wings or Class AA Harrisburg Senators. Who backs up shortstop Trea Turner in that scenario? Turner rarely sits, and Castro, Kieboom and Harrison could all spell him in a pinch.\n\nOther bench options on the 40-man roster are infielders Jake Noll and Yasel Antuna, outfielder Yadiel Hern\u00e1ndez and catcher Tres Barrera. Hern\u00e1ndez, also a left-handed hitter, is a possibility after debuting in September. Antuna, like Garc\u00eda, is a top prospect who will almost certainly start the season in the minors. The Nationals don\u2019t typically carry a third catcher, removing Barrera from the immediate discussion.\n\nBut, as far as Parra is concerned, this is looking too far ahead.

Then free agency led him elsewhere.", "published": "Wed, 03 Feb 2021 05:00:09 EST", "body": "But Washington grew on Doolittle, and Doolittle grew on Washington. Neither took long. Doolittle pitched in 142\u2154 innings for the Nationals and had a 3.03 ERA. He finished four of the 12 wins needed to take the World Series in 2019. He and his wife, Eireann Dolan, spread themselves across the D.C. area, working with the LGBTQ community, veterans and the Washington Nationals Youth Baseball Academy, among other groups. And by September, in the weeks before Doolittle became a banged-up free agent, in the last month of a season that tested him more than any in his career, both of them wanted to stay.\n\nThat just wasn\u2019t in the Nationals\u2019 plans. They went and built a bullpen without him. Then Doolittle agreed to a one-year deal with the Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday, taking his left arm somewhere else.\n\n\u201cThe city has meant so much to us,\u201d Doolittle, 34, told The Washington Post in September. \u201cMy wife and I got married here, you know? This has been our home for four years, and we try to get involved in the community just to show how appreciative we are, for the support that we\u2019ve gotten, and to show people how much we love D.C.\u201d\n\nDoolittle was hurt throughout his run in Washington. He talked openly about frustration with his body, that it couldn\u2019t always hold up enough for him to anchor the bullpen without pauses. He joked that he was middle-aged and lucky to be a lefty or else baseball would have spit him out years ago. It was easy to see how much each setback bothered him. He wanted to be accountable and pitch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA string of left foot injuries held him to 45 innings in 2018, the first full year after the Nationals traded top prospect Jes\u00fas Luzardo to acquire Doolittle from the Athletics. (He still finished with a 1.60 ERA.) In 2019, when he was overused to lift a historically bad bullpen, he missed two weeks in August with right knee tendinitis and publicly ceded the closer label to Daniel Hudson. (He still finished 55 games, the most in the National League.) And in 2020, after spending part of the summer on the injured list, Doolittle\u2019s last act was limping off the field, Nationals Park empty around him, his right oblique strained.\n\nMaybe this was fitting. It certainly was cruel. A player loved by the fan base \u2014 and so often reinventing himself amid injuries \u2014 was never afforded a final ovation. The coronavirus pandemic kept Washington from celebrating its title, then had Doolittle, Howie Kendrick, Adam Eaton, An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, Kurt Suzuki and Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera \u2014 all key members of the championship team \u2014 exit without goodbyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a really rewarding four years,\u201d Doolittle said in September, when it was not yet certain he would leave Washington, so he was not yet ready to reflect on what that would mean. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know; I\u2019ve been thinking about that a lot and just trying to stay grateful for all the good things that have happened since I\u2019ve put this uniform on in 2017.\u201d\n\nMany of Doolittle\u2019s highlights came off the mound. There were his regular charity efforts. There was his affection for independent bookstores, for the Nationals\u2019 bullpen cart, for celebrating playoff wins with a blue lightsaber. But more often \u2014 and at times unintentionally \u2014 his willingness to discuss issues within and outside the sport thrust him into the public eye.\n\nHe spoke up in July 2018 when several major leaguers had old tweets publicized, all of which included some form of insensitive language. It didn\u2019t matter that one of the players was Trea Turner, whom Doolittle shared a clubhouse with in Washington. Doolittle had a private conversation with Turner and later spoke with reporters at length about inclusivity in baseball.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter the Nationals won the World Series, Doolittle decided not to attend the White House celebration. His problem was with President Donald Trump and his \u201cdivisive rhetoric and the enabling of conspiracy theories and widening the divide in this country.\u201d Doolittle and Dolan then advised other couples who did not want to attend the ceremony but feared retribution.\n\nThen Doolittle spoke up again in 2020 as the sport restarted during a global pandemic. He was frustrated with how negotiations between the owners and the players\u2019 union centered on finances, not health and safety. He said that \u201csports are like the reward of a functioning society,\u201d suggesting America hadn\u2019t earned baseball \u2014 or concerts or indoor dining \u2014 with its coronavirus response.\n\nAD\n\nBut the summer also reignited his passion for pitching. He had considered retiring before opting in for a troubled season. He then struggled, went to the injured list with knee soreness and wound up in Fredericksburg, Va., at the club\u2019s alternate site, with other hopefuls. He had to tweak his mechanics to restore the life of his fastball. His chances of another major league contract may have hinged on it. He felt refreshed, like a rookie again, rearing and starting from scratch.\n\nAD\n\nThat was until he strained his oblique Sept. 10. Yet he put enough on tape and showed enough improvement that the Reds added him to their immediate future. Doolittle has spent the winter rehabbing in Tempe, Ariz. The Nationals, meanwhile, signed Brad Hand and Sam Clay, left-handed relievers who squeezed Doolittle out. It was just more whittling down of the team that brought D.C. its first title since 1924. Perhaps Doolittle and the rest will return one day to see the banner flying beyond left field. Perhaps, on that same day, Nationals Park will be filled with people.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZUSWG6OJYNHHBILY26LHSYRS3A.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9848542809486389}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Doolittle pitched in 142\u2154 innings for the Nationals and had a 3.03 ERA.

Not long after, with the three of them seated at a table in a hotel suite, Morrison understood why. It was an intense, six-hour interview, but Morrison remembered Rivera was engaging and well-prepared \u2014 and when Hurney asked Rivera about his football philosophy, it became obvious that \u201cthere was chemistry between the two.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see football the same way,\u201d Rivera said in a recent interview. \u201cWe\u2019re a little bit of a throwback from the old days compared to how things are evolving very quickly right now. And I still think you win football games by being a physical football team, playing downhill, running the ball successfully, stopping the run, pressuring the quarterback.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTen Januarys later, Rivera and Hurney traded places. The Washington Football Team coach was sitting across from Hurney in Northern Virginia, interviewing him for a job. They had worked together in Carolina for five years (2011-12 and 2017-19), but after an ownership change and underperformance, the Panthers had fired them in consecutive seasons. Now, at the start of the second year of his effort to turn Washington into a winner, Rivera hired his old comrade as the team\u2019s executive vice president of football and player personnel.\n\nThis setup, though, is not Carolina Part 2. During a recent virtual news conference, the team\u2019s top trio \u2014 Rivera, Hurney and General Manager Martin Mayhew, who was hired at the same time as Hurney \u2014 preached collaboration. Hurney and Mayhew are expected to be behind the scenes in the coach-centric model led by Rivera, whom owner Daniel Snyder called the organization\u2019s \u201cone voice\u201d when he hired him last year.\n\nMayhew is the face of the personnel department, and he and Hurney will lead as de facto co-GMs. Mayhew is expected to assume more in-house responsibilities, such as the salary cap and contract negotiations, while Hurney, 65, will spend more time on the road scouting. The two will form a brain trust with Rob Rogers, senior vice president of football administration, to provide counsel for Rivera and make recommendations.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that matters to either one of us is to win games,\u201d Hurney said Feb. 3 while sitting beside Mayhew during the news conference. \u201cThat\u2019s all it\u2019s about. Having people that you really like personally and you respect professionally and you can have fun with and work extremely hard \u2014 I think that\u2019s the ideal situation. That\u2019s the way I view this.\u201d\n\nBuilding a consensus\n\nOn March 12, as NFL teams began to pull their scouting staffs off the road because of the coronavirus pandemic, Hurney traveled to Oregon\u2019s pro day and was the only NFL GM to attend quarterback Justin Herbert\u2019s workout. Hurney\u2019s decision embodied his belief that there\u2019s no substitute for in-person evaluation. To Rivera, it \u201cepitomizes who Marty is.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMarty\u2019s a road GM,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to be in the office. He wants to be out there, the touchy-feely type of guy [who likes] to see things.\u201d\n\nThat Hurney and Rivera are kindred spirits might seem odd at first. One of the only obvious overlaps between the globe-trotting Army brat (Rivera) and the middle-class suburbanite from Wheaton (Hurney) was that each had three brothers. In the mid-1970s, Rivera became a star high school athlete in Southern California as Hurney grappled with the limits of his ability as an undersized guard on the club football team at Catholic University.\n\nYet they shared an obsession with football. Former college coach Joe Pascale remembered Hurney \u2014 about 5-foot-11 and 170 pounds \u2014 as a decent player whose brain outpaced his body. Hurney would grill coaches to understand his role. Once, Pascale recalled while laughing, Hurney argued about blocking technique with assistant coach Ralph Sonntag, a former Maryland lineman who was named the ACC\u2019s best blocker in 1969.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter his sophomore year, Hurney stopped playing to focus on the Tower, the student newspaper. He was the sports editor and sometimes wrote about his old team\u2019s games.\n\n\u201cHe was interested in how you build things, how you get it together and be successful,\u201d Pascale said. He chuckled remembering Hurney\u2019s questions and adopted a young, high-pitched voice. \u201c \u2018Who\u2019s the QB? How\u2019s the offense look? What\u2019s the most important position you have to fill next year?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter graduation, Hurney became a reporter. He ascended to the NFL beat at the Washington Times, and one colleague later wrote that Hurney\u2019s \u201cprose had the lyrical quality of a Gatling gun, but he could find news.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn 1988, Hurney left journalism for a job in Washington\u2019s public relations department, working alongside GM Bobby Beathard and Coach Joe Gibbs. Two years later, Beathard left for San Diego and took Hurney with him. Hurney handled the scouting department, player contracts and football administration, and Rivera believes Beathard helped instill the \u201cold-school\u201d principles that he and Hurney share.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2002, Carolina named Hurney its GM. That offseason, the front office was split on young free agent quarterback Jake Delhomme, and Hurney applied what he had learned from Beathard and Gibbs about talking through major decisions until they reached a consensus.\n\n\u201cThere were some reservations,\u201d director of pro scouting Mark Koncz told the Rock Hill (S.C.) Herald a few years later. \u201cBut Marty got everybody on the same page. We discussed it and discussed it, and by the time we made a final decision, everybody was there together.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe next year, Delhomme led the Panthers to the Super Bowl. Now, Rivera believes such bridge-building will be crucial. He explained that if a front-office debate ends without consensus, people will say something they shouldn\u2019t to another team, an agent or the media.\n\n\u201cOne thing I appreciate about Marty,\u201d he said, \u201cis that Marty wants to be on the same page.\u201d\n\n\u2018The right kind of people\u2019\n\nIn the beginning of the Hurney-Rivera partnership, it was all sunshine. The Panthers improved in Rivera\u2019s first season to finish 6-10 with rookie of the year quarterback Cam Newton. Team staffers noticed the coach and GM got along well, often chatting before meetings and sitting together on the road.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201c[The culture they fostered] made a huge difference coming to work every day,\u201d longtime video director Mark Hobbs said. \u201cIt\u2019s a grind, but if you\u2019ve got an environment where everyone\u2019s on the same page, you just work that much harder. \u2026 I just wanted to win for Marty and for Ron.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment arose because Hurney and Rivera are similar not only in how they see the schematics of football, said J.C. Glick, a retired Army ranger and former Panthers consultant, but in that they put people first.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an outcomes-based business,\u201d Glick added, \u201cbut [they understand] outcomes are only possible with people.\u201d\n\nHurney also drew admiration for his ability to evaluate players. Morrison, the team president, remembered watching the first draft after he was hired and being impressed by the front office\u2019s discipline to its board. He noticed Hurney often hit on prospects whom the Panthers had rated higher than other teams. This included linebacker Luke Kuechly, who, as Morrison noted, was not an obvious pick at No. 9 overall in 2012 because the Panthers were deep at the position.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut one of Hurney\u2019s traits that his co-workers loved \u2014 loyalty \u2014 also got him in trouble. He overpaid players he had drafted, which hamstrung the roster and contributed to the team\u2019s disappointing start in 2012. By October of that year the Panthers were 1-5, the worst record in the NFC, and owner Jerry Richardson fired Hurney.\n\nIn 2015, Rivera and Hurney\u2019s replacement, Dave Gettleman, built one of the best teams of the decade as the Panthers went 15-1 and lost to the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl. But two years later, in a surprising move days before the team started training camp, Richardson fired Gettleman and rehired Hurney. He was, for the first time, reunited with Rivera.\n\n\u201cIt was almost like nothing changed,\u201d Hobbs said. \u201cIt was almost like [Hurney had] never been gone.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThree years later, after the Panthers backslid and fired Rivera, the coach called up his old friend. They found themselves rehashing decisions they had made in their five years together. The reason Rivera said he hired Hurney in Washington wasn\u2019t only because of familiarity. It was also because, in discussing their mistakes, they were aligned on what they should have done differently.\n\nAD\n\nFor example, Rivera said the Panthers didn\u2019t re-sign defensive tackle Star Lotulelei in 2018 in part because statistics indicated he wasn\u2019t worth the $10 million per year the Buffalo Bills gave him. But the next season, Rivera saw Kuechly, the linebacker, slip from his all-pro level of play without Lotulelei lined up in front of him.\n\n\u201cWhen you watch the tape, he\u2019s running for his life because there\u2019s nobody keeping him clean,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody keeping that guard-center combination from working to the next level to cut Luke off. That\u2019s the thing that you sit there and go, \u2018Oh.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNow, in the third phase of their partnership, Rivera and Hurney must avoid previous mistakes. They must incorporate Mayhew, an important new voice with a wealth of experience of his own, and actualize the collaboration they emphasized.\n\nIn that first news conference, a reporter asked what the key was for Washington to become a winning franchise again. After Mayhew finished his answer, Hurney did in public what the trio said has been happening in private \u2014 and what will need to happen every day if this revamped front office is to succeed.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M2GVGHR4CZEXPDLDHOB5B34B24.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9959002137184143}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Before the meeting , Hurney told Panthers team president and coaching - search partner Danny Morrison about how he had been impressed with Rivera \u2019s presence the first time they met.

Oshie said.\n\nThe practice marked the first time the Capitals had a full roster available to them since Jan. 19, when the Capitals played the Penguins at PPG Paints Arena. Four players \u2014 Alex Ovechkin, Evgeny Kuznetsov, Dmitry Orlov and Ilya Samsonov \u2014 were added to the NHL\u2019s covid-19 protocol list on Jan. 20 after Samsonov tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen the Capitals began dealing with injury after injury.\n\nTom Wilson missed two games after a lower-body injury Jan. 22 against the Buffalo Sabres. Lars Eller missed four games after he was crunched along the boards Jan. 26 against the New York Islanders. Justin Schultz has missed four games since he took a puck to the face Jan. 28 against the Islanders. Conor Sheary missed one game with a knee injury suffered Feb. 1 against Boston. Even Oshie missed a game with an upper-body injury.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a weird year,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cObviously ups and downs, guys in and out of the lineup. That will probably be a theme for the whole year, but it is good timing for us to reset, focus on our game, get some key guys back and get other guys back who are nursing some things.\u201d\n\nTaxi squad players and emergency roster exemptions were needed, as well as call ups from the Hershey Bears, the team\u2019s American Hockey League affiliate. At one point, the Capitals had to go with 11 forwards and seven defensemen because they did not have enough salary cap space to call up another forward.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the team seems to have everyone back. Ovechkin and Orlov were cleared to return Jan. 30. Kuznetsov and Samsonov were cleared Monday. Jakub Vrana, who entered the covid-19 protocols Saturday, was removed from the list Tuesday.\n\nNow the coronavirus issues leaguewide are the biggest concern.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, I don\u2019t want to say I expected it, but I think from the league\u2019s perspective or players\u2019, I think we knew it wasn\u2019t going to go perfectly,\u201d defenseman John Carlson said.\n\nCapitals Coach Peter Laviolette said he expects to have every player available against Pittsburgh on Sunday. Laviolette said he is not sure whether they would have had their full roster available for Tuesday\u2019s game against the Philadelphia Flyers, but they were \u201cawfully close.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe game was postponed because of a coronavirus issue in Philadelphia. The Flyers\u2019 facilities are shut down through Sunday.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are in the thick of things right now,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThere is going to be adversity. I\u2019m kind of just like wake up, see what our team services guy \u2026 has sent us for that day and then just go for it. Sometimes even on a day-to-day basis, like Philly, you wake up thinking you got a game and there is not. There is no reason to really be bent out of shape or get worried or frustrated with anything. Just do our job and be ready when we have to drop the puck.\u201d\n\nWith the players getting back to full strength, the Capitals also know they have plenty to work on. After going 3-0-1 without Ovechkin, Kuznetsov, Orlov or Samsonov, the Capitals are still looking for their first February win.\n\nAD\n\nThe Capitals have allowed at least three goals in 10 of 12 games and have repeatedly talked about getting better in their defensive zone. They tend to get caught flat-footed, such as in last week\u2019s 4-2 loss to the Rangers when New York defenseman Anthony Bitetto skated from behind the net, curled to the point basically unbothered and beat Vitek Vanecek for just his third goal in 185 career games.\n\nAD\n\nAnother issue has been an inability to hold leads. Center Nicklas Backstrom said the Capitals have grown passive when playing with a lead when aggressiveness is necessary.\n\n\u201cTeams are going to take you apart if you\u2019re passive and just try to protect the lead at all times,\u201d Backstrom said. \u201cThat\u2019s an area we talked about we got to be better at. Even if we\u2019re up a couple goals in the third, the easiest way to defend is probably attacking and keep the puck and possession.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWith a shortened training camp, this mini-pause gives players a chance to better understand Laviolette\u2019s system while also addressing the issues that have cropped up in the season\u2019s first 12 games.\n\n\u201cI think [this break] is certainly good for us right now \u2026 but at the same time, who knows how this year is going to go?\u201d Carlson said. \u201cLike this month for us was probably going to be our busiest month with the most games and travel \u2026 so if you just attach this to the end of the year, so to speak, then it\u2019s not the best thing in the world to have going into the playoffs either.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O4V2ULTJN4I6XJTO4JYEN2PITA.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9422180652618408}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Four players \u2014 Alex Ovechkin , Evgeny Kuznetsov , Dmitry Orlov and Ilya Samsonov \u2014 were added to the NHL \u2019s covid-19 protocol list on Jan. 20 after Samsonov tested positive for the coronavirus. \n\n The practice marked the first time the Capitals had a full roster available to them since Jan. 19 , when the Capitals played the Penguins at PPG Paints Arena."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "f4b74be7-a566-4e8d-b499-1710a41210ed", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "The Caps are dealing with an unexpected break.

Contact tracing has begun, the league said, and Thursday\u2019s game between the Ducks and Golden Knights remains on schedule.\n\nCenter Lars Eller, who is one of the Capitals\u2019 representatives with the players\u2019 union, said the league\u2019s guidance might need to evolve if outbreaks continue to occur.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cProbably more can be done than just masks and distancing because we are doing all those things and if that alone was enough, we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation,\u201d he said.\n\nOshie said adjusting to the NHL\u2019s virus guidelines has been \u201cfine\u201d and that getting tested at the rink each morning, wearing masks and social distancing in the locker room has become the norm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s crazy times, and I\u2019m not too scared of getting it personally, but I\u2019m following all the rules that I\u2019ve been told to follow,\u201d Oshie said.\n\nAD\n\nThe break in play, though unplanned, gives the once-ailing Capitals a chance to reset.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember us missing so many bodies ever at one time \u2014 goalies, defensemen, several forwards, all regular players,\u201d Eller said. \u201cIt is great for us. Hopefully we can have a healthy lineup once we start playing again. That will do us good.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCenter Evgeny Kuznetsov and goaltender Ilya Samsonov came off the covid-19 list Monday, and they both needed some more practice time before they could get back to full speed. The pair missed eight games while they were on the list.\n\nBoth players said they experienced symptoms while they were away from the team. Samsonov, through an interpreter, said he had trouble breathing and walking at times, and there were a few days when he felt \u201cpretty sick.\u201d\n\nDefenseman Justin Schultz also rejoined the group Monday after taking a puck to the face Jan. 28. He was skating with a full face shield Wednesday and was listed as day-to-day.\n\nAD\n\nThe lack of games also gives more practice time to Jakub Vrana, who came off the covid-19 list Tuesday. Players can be put on the list for multiple reasons, including if they had a positive test, are in contact tracing or are symptomatic.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think as a team, it\u2019s good [to have this break]. Guys banged up, guys getting back into game shape,\u201d Oshie said. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the way you approach it. \u2026 It\u2019s nice for guys to be able to get their bodies right.\u201d\n\nOshie, who missed one game with an upper-body injury, was back with the team Wednesday. He said he was feeling \u201cgreat and back to normal.\u201d\n\nOshie described the injury as \u201ckind of a freak thing\u201d that didn\u2019t occur in a game. The winger said he would have been able to play Tuesday if that game hadn\u2019t been postponed.\n\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve been playing the season for a long time, but I know we\u2019re still pretty early in the year, so it\u2019s a good time for guys to reset their bodies,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNote: Michael Peca was added to Coach Peter Laviolette\u2019s staff as a player development coach. Peca, who will mostly work with the taxi squad, played under Laviolette with the New York Islanders in the early 2000s.

Three-and-three in the last six,\u201d Brooks said, describing the Wizards\u2019 roller coaster of a week. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve gone through, I\u2019m not usually fired up about 3-3, but we\u2019ve gone through a lot, and our guys battled back.\u201d\n\nWashington held the struggling Bulls (9-14) to 42.4 percent shooting from the field and made big plays when it needed them, including a pair of six-point possessions in the second half that kept Chicago from taking leads.\n\nThe Bulls whittled the Wizards\u2019 double-digit lead to one thrice in the second half, the last time on a running floater from Coby White coming out of a timeout to make it 102-101 with 29.2 seconds left. Bradley Beal drew a foul at the other end but missed his first free throw, and the Wizards led by two with 9.8 seconds to play before Len made the defensive play of the game with less than two seconds remaining.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just try to jump as vertical as I can and meet [LaVine] just a little bit further from the rim,\u201d said Len, who is 7-foot. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the most athletic player in our league. . . . He\u2019s so athletic, he might dunk it. I mean, he\u2019s dunked on me before. You\u2019ve got to meet him a little bit further from the rim because if you give him that little space, he\u2019s too good.\u201d\n\nBeal iced the win with two free throws and led the Wizards with 35 points on 10-for-24 shooting and a 14-for-15 showing at the line.\n\nWith Russell Westbrook out for rest, starting forward Rui Hachimura was Beal\u2019s second-in-command all night and got something worth celebrating on his 23rd birthday.\n\nAD\n\nHachimura had 19 points and 10 rebounds for his first double-double of the season, but his highlight-reel moment came with 1:17 left in the third quarter, when he bounced up from where he had been knocked to the floor under the basket, grinned and held his fists aloft.\n\nAD\n\nHe had earned his gift \u2014 Hachimura had drawn the second charge of his young NBA career, against Bulls forward Patrick Williams, and it was evidence of the strong night he was having on defense.\n\n\u201cRui don\u2019t take charges,\u201d Beal said afterward, laughing. \u201c. . . Rui\u2019s not a fan of taking charges, respectfully. And I don\u2019t think any man\u2019s going to be super, like, charged up to want to step in front of big bodies like that, but that was a big play tonight. Sacrificed his body for the benefit of the team, and he had a big night tonight. It was his day, for sure. On the floor and off.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSaid Hachimura: \u201cThat was a big step for me. Everybody talks about my defense a lot. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a bad defender. That was a big step for me, for sure.\u201d\n\nThe birthday boy wasn\u2019t alone in putting together a complete game. Washington had four scorers in double figures, perhaps in part because of a tweak in the starting lineup on Brooks\u2019s end, and on the defensive end the Wizards did what was needed to keep Chicago in check.\n\nThe Bulls, middling on offense as it is, were missing second-leading scorer Lauri Markkanen with a right shoulder injury. LaVine finished with 35 points, but no other Chicago player had more than 14.\n\nAD\n\nBrooks gave Davis Bertans his first start since December 2019 in hopes of \u201cactivating\u201d the sharpshooter, who has been largely dormant this season. The forward has struggled with his conditioning all year \u2014 Bertans joined the Wizards late because of visa issues returning to Washington from his native Latvia, where he waited out the league\u2019s coronavirus pause and sat out the NBA bubble before signing a five-year, $80 million contract on the first day of free agency ahead of the season.\n\nAD\n\nAfter struggling to get into game shape through early January, he was one of six players in the league\u2019s coronavirus protocols during the Wizards\u2019 two-week, virus-induced pause.\n\nBrooks hoped inserting him into the starting lineup was one solution to get Bertans more minutes \u2014 and opportunities \u2014 but in shorter increments.\n\nAD\n\nIt worked, for a time: Bertans was shooting a career-low 32.8 percent from three-point range heading into Monday\u2019s game, but he made 4 of 8 from deep in the first half, helping Washington to a 58-48 lead at halftime.

When pools reopened, he resumed training at Lee District RECenter in Alexandria.\n\nAD\n\nBut he still didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d have a sophomore season. Now that he has the championship under his belt, he said he feels confident in ramping up his training and going for two more.\n\nAD\n\nIn the Class 6 girls\u2019 meet, Washington-Liberty sophomore Ellie Joyce added a state title to the regional title she won last weekend. She said she felt confident after that title, which gave her the highest qualifying score of any contender Wednesday, and just needed to deliver the same performance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to go up there thinking about what you\u2019re going to do well rather than what could go wrong,\u201d Joyce said.\n\nAs it turned out, she bettered her previous score with a 478.95, outlasting Lake Braddock\u2019s Elisabeth Rockefeller (448.05) and Oakton\u2019s Maddie Reese (443.30).\n\nAD\n\nIn the Class 5 championships Tuesday, John Lewis High senior Ari Snow captured his second state title and it came with a bit of drama. He had struggled with his ninth dive, dropping into second place after leading most of the way. His 10th involved two backflips.

Coach Jared Van Acker watched the players as they went through high-knees and Frankensteins, asking them to control their eagerness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTake your time, nice and easy,\u201d he told a set of skill position players. \u201cDon\u2019t want to pull anything.\u201d\n\nVan Acker is a big believer in controlling what you can control. It\u2019s a motto that has been tested over the past 11 months as the pandemic took control of just about everything and everyone.\n\nIn the spring it contained players to garages and basements and public parks, anywhere they were able train on their own until the team could gather again. In the summer it made them uncertain about the likelihood of a season. In the fall it spaced them six feet apart at team workouts, kept footballs and equipment out of their hands.\n\nIn the case of senior quarterback Joe Pesansky, the pandemic sent him several states south in search of a fall season and a better shot at earning a Division I scholarship.\n\nPesansky was one of many local players who opted to go elsewhere in favor of looser restrictions and a chance to play. The quarterback\u2019s absence Thursday was another reminder of all that had changed for the Cavaliers. It was the first \u2014 and surely not the last \u2014 sign that this long-awaited season would be a strange one.\n\nTime to go\n\nAfter warmups, players grabbed their helmets. But before they could strap them on, they lined up in front of an assistant coach to get the inside sprayed with disinfectant.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVirginia public schools are the only local programs currently starting with fall sports; most schools in D.C. and Maryland remain sidelined. The condensed Virginia schedule is set to run through May 1, featuring six regular season games followed by the postseason.\n\nThe plan was proposed in late July, following the announcement that fall sports would not begin on time. It was after this news that Pesansky and his family more seriously discussed a move to Florida. Pesansky\u2019s father had been offered a job opportunity in the Tampa area but had planned to put it off until after Joe\u2019s graduation. After all, the rising senior had become a celebrated member of the Cavaliers\u2019 athletic department, a charismatic leader for both the football and basketball programs. He had helped lead the football team to its first playoff win in nearly a decade as a sophomore and earned all-district honors in basketball as a junior.\n\nBut Pesansky badly wanted to earn a Division I football scholarship, and coming out of his junior season he hadn\u2019t generated enough interest. He feared that no fall tape would bring his already stunted recruitment to a halt. At one of the team\u2019s distanced summer workouts, the starting quarterback gathered his teammates together and told them he had to leave.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe just brought so much to this program,\u201d junior defensive back Chris DoBrydney said. \u201cNot only was he a very good football player, but his leadership made everybody listen to him.\u201d\n\nPesansky and his family were in Florida by the first week in August. He enrolled at Jesuit High, a private school in Tampa that a cousin attended.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the more difficult processes that I\u2019ve ever had to go through,\u201d Pesansky said. \u201cEven after I left, I had to do everything at once. I had to start school, learn the playbook. I had to meet new people, new coaches, new teachers.\u201d\n\nAs Pesansky got settled, the Cavaliers moved forward, continuing outdoor conditioning, maxing out sessions capped for safety purposes at 50 players and coaches.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Van Acker watched a live stream of every one of Pesansky\u2019s 15 games for Jesuit, looking on as the former Cavalier set program records for touchdowns and passing yards.\n\nAD\n\nBy November, Pesansky received a scholarship offer to Holy Cross, a Football Championship Subdivision program in Massachusetts, and committed to the Crusaders a week later. After the season he was named Florida 5A player of the year and finished second in the state\u2019s Mr. Football voting.\n\nAs the Cavaliers waited for their season to begin, Pesansky stayed in touch with his former teammates up north, especially junior Christian Hilton, who would be taking over QB duties.\n\n\u201cWe were just trying to help each other get better,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cTrying to stay motivated through these strange times.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAs the winter began and Virginia inched closer toward a tenuous football start date, Pesansky wrapped up football and began his basketball season. Everything had seemingly worked out for the best. But that didn\u2019t mean everything felt the same.\n\n\u201cLike we just had our basketball senior night, but it\u2019s not really with your seniors,\u201d Pesansky said. \u201cIt\u2019s with a bunch of guys you just met. And that\u2019s a little different.\u201d\n\nFinally, football\n\nWoodson\u2019s first game is in a little more than two weeks. If the expedited preparation period isn\u2019t enough of a reminder that this will be an unusual season, it should help that their opener will be played Feb. 22 \u2014 a Monday night.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMissing out on the traditional Friday night lights for a week is not something the team can control. The Cavaliers are used to inconveniences big and small. That made Thursday\u2019s practice all the more enjoyable. It was familiar. It was fun.\n\n\u201cThis is going well,\u201d Hilton said midway through. \u201cPeople are motivated. They\u2019re excited just to be out of the house, just to be out in the fresh air getting exercise. Finally playing football after a long, long wait.\u201d\n\nBy 5:30, the stadium lights had been flipped on and the temperature had dipped into the low 40s. But the energy was high and the air was filled with the sounds of whistles and grunts and laughter. Despite their extended absence, the rhythms of a normal football practice had returned.\n\nAD\n\nAround that same time, 900 miles away, Pesansky got out of basketball practice at Jesuit. He exited into a warm Tampa evening with plans to call some of his former teammates that night. He knew they had been waiting for today, and he wanted to hear all about it.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RFXESDDHIUI6XOVYOB7YO2OXQU.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9018620848655701}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The condensed Virginia schedule is set to run through May 1 , featuring six regular season games followed by the postseason. \n\n It was also the first time the Cavaliers held a practice together in 15 months."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "6a01e538-3633-4d3b-aace-7d91e770f779", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "The Langley hockey team didn\u2019t have a goaltender, so it turned to a swimmer", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/02/03/langley-goalie-leo-song/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_sports", "description": "Junior goaltender Leo Song had never played hockey before this season.

Two of his rising goaltenders transferred, prompting Keough to use social media and a widespread email to find a new netminder.\n\nAD\n\nSong, meanwhile, was preparing for the upcoming club swim season when his friend Alston Zhang, a junior defenseman for Langley, texted, asking him to join the team. \u201cI was tired of swimming, and it was like a God-sent opportunity to try a sport I was already interested in, [so] I took it,\u201d said Song, who could skate a little bit.\n\nAD\n\nIn early August, Keough and senior captain Charlie Tourbaf went to a Starbucks for an introduction with their future 6-foot-1, 185-pound goalie, whose only hockey experience was an online referee training course. Tourbaf admitted he was nervous about the team\u2019s prospects.\n\nKeough didn\u2019t hold back. He explained to Song and a Langley lacrosse player, who lasted two weeks before quitting, that playing goalie was going to be the hardest thing they ever did. \u201cIt\u2019s going to suck, and it\u2019s going to suck some more with the training,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut once you taste ice hockey, everything is going to seem boring after that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSong returned home from the meeting and surprised his father, Jay, with the news that he was playing hockey, a sport that was never talked about in their household.\n\n\u201cI was like \u2018Are you serious?\u2019 \u201d the father said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any hockey gear and never had any official training, and he told me that he got the position.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe team funded most of Song\u2019s equipment as well as his skating and goalie lessons.\n\nSong spent September working with a private skating instructor before going to the Goalie Academy in Loudoun County to learn the basics of the position. During his first day of goalie lessons in October, he was surrounded by 7- and 8-year-old children.\n\nAD\n\nTraining, on Sunday mornings, included skating movements such as butterflying and shuffling. It progressed to standing in the crease and catching shots with the glove hand to work on hand-eye coordination. Later on, a trainer skated down the ice and fired shots at Song so he could get used to breakaways.\n\nAt a practice a couple of weeks before Langley\u2019s season opener, Song was in the crease, standing awkwardly over the blue paint. As shots rocketed past the rookie, Keough turned to his coaching staff: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long season, boys.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLangley entered its first game against Fauquier/Highlands on Oct. 30 hoping the opponent had not figured out that the team\u2019s starting goalie was a longtime swimmer. As Fauquier persistently put shots on net during the first period, it was clear the secret was out.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI can tell he was worried that the rest of the team was going to hang a loss on his shoulder,\u201d said Keough, who led Langley to its first Northern Virginia School Hockey League championship in 2019. \u201cThen I watched his teammates fight for every puck and keep down the shots on net. That\u2019s when he realized these guys got [his] back no matter what.\u201d\n\nLangley trailed 3-2 before the team scored six consecutive goals and used strong defense to fuel an 8-3 win, Song\u2019s first victory.\n\nJay Song is stunned every time he sees his son in hockey gear.

The opposing player jetted the puck toward the net, and Song, surprising himself, caught it in his glove, sending the Saxons\u2019 bench into a frenzy.\n\n\u201cYou would\u2019ve thought we won the national championship from the reaction on the bench,\u201d Keough said. \u201cThe team just rallies behind every success he has had.\u201d\n\nLangley has won three straight games after starting the season 1-4. During moments when opponents were putting shots past Song at a high rate, he remained determined to improve. The team has learned to adapt to his inexperience by emphasizing defense.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHis growth has been phenomenal,\u201d Tourbaf said. \u201cHe went from not being able to stop any shot on the ground to moving across the ice and blocking a ton of shots.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe butterflies still flutter around Song\u2019s stomach each game. But the team camaraderie provides comfort. When asked which sport he prefers, Song didn\u2019t hesitate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stick with hockey,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is way better.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L2E363WBQRGZPPNPBRJLKGJ7OY.JPG&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.999006986618042}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "AD \n\n Song , meanwhile , was preparing for the upcoming club swim season when his friend Alston Zhang , a junior defenseman for Langley , texted , asking him to join the team \u201c. \n\n AD \n\n In early August , Keough and senior captain Charlie Tourbaf went to a Starbucks for an introduction with their future 6 - foot-1 , 185 - pound goalie , whose only hockey experience was an online referee training course."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "91698cff-6c20-4d50-8a48-d25dd0d948c1", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "Prince George\u2019s officials apologize for vaccine rollout, promise improvements", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/prince-georges-officials-apologize-for-vaccine-rollout-promise-improvements/2021/02/13/4fa08c22-6e1a-11eb-9ead-673168d5b874_story.html", "description": "In a tele-town hall attended by more than 48,000 residents, Angela Alsobrooks acknowledged technological issues, short supply.", "published": "Sat, 13 Feb 2021 19:56:39 +0000", "body": "\u201cI have received your calls.

All residents in need of a second shot will be contacted by the health department a week before their appointment, she said, to ensure they are signed up.\n\nAnd starting the week of Feb. 15, she said all residents will receive the times for their second appointments at the same time as their first to minimize confusion.\n\nAt this point, the county is still working through vaccinating residents in categories 1A, which includes healthcare workers and first responders, and 1B, which includes anyone over age 75 and teachers.

She said the county\u2019s Office of Information Technology is working to build its own website that she hopes will be more user-friendly, but there is not yet a timeline for its launch.\n\nHealth department staff will begin using their own scheduling system to make appointments further out, including in March and April, she said, which means the pre-registration waitlist should dramatically decrease in coming weeks.\n\nAD\n\nIn this new system, residents will not receive a link where they can choose their appointments, but instead get assigned a time and place.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPlease be flexible,\u201d Alsobrooks said, adding that the process made more sense for seniors who are not Internet-savvy.\n\nAlsobrooks said that officials\u2019 main concern is vaccine supply. She said the county was pleased when the state guaranteed the health department would receive 4,200 doses per week for the next four weeks. Previously, the health department was guaranteed just 975 doses per week, she said, although it often received more than that.\n\nWhen asked by a resident why Montgomery\u2019s health department has received about twice as many doses as Prince George\u2019s health department \u2014 42,400 compared to 20,875 \u2014 Alsobrooks said she has signed onto a letter to the state asking for more transparency in how doses are being administered.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt is not equitable for Prince George\u2019s to have received less vaccine than other jurisdictions,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no excuse for it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGov. Larry Hogan (R) has said he wants to send vaccines to providers that are getting them out the door quickly, including using a network of providers outside the health department. Of Maryland\u2019s 24 jurisdictions, Prince George\u2019s ranks last in terms of percentage of doses administered, according to state data.\n\nThe state does not publicly disclose where doses are distributed within each county, and there is no way to track where doses siphoned away from the health department have been distributed instead.\n\nOn average, 37 percent of doses statewide have gone to local health departments, the share sent to Prince George\u2019s appears significantly lower.\n\nAD\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMike Ricci, a spokesman for Gov.

On the Virginia shore, the landing where the ferry anchors sits on property belonging to Rockland Farm, a family-owned establishment that has been operating since 1817.\n\nFor much of the 1900s, the Maryland family that owned the ferry paid the Virginia family on other side $5 per year to use the landing. (Both families had the surname of Brown, but they were not related.) They began sparring over the landing size and cost in the early 2000s, a battle that escalated into a judge\u2019s ruling in November declaring that the Rockland Farm owners should be paid $102,000 in damages for trespassing, property damage and breach of contract.\n\nThe farm owners will now restart the negotiations with the Kuhn family, hoping that this time, they can get what they see as a fair price for the use of their land.\n\n\u201cWe hope that he\u2019ll be more reasonable to deal with than the prior owners,\u201d said Libby Devlin, one of Rockland\u2019s owners.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe moving mogul has bought numerous Virginia landmarks in recent years in an effort to preserve historic places and environmental sanctuaries. A spokeswoman said Kuhn and his wife paid cash for the ferry, the piece of Maryland shoreline it occupies and the store on the property, but would not disclose the price.\n\nThe Kuhns announced that they plan to either purchase the Virginia land from the Rockland owners or negotiate a permanent easement, \u201cso that the ferry never ceases operating again.\u201d They believe that once the Virginia negotiations are handled, they can have the boat operating again within a week.\n\nBut Devlin said her family isn\u2019t interested in a permanent easement, which would allow the Kuhns to operate the ferry on their land while the farm retains ownership.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been there, done that, and it doesn\u2019t serve us well,\u201d Devlin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been burned by permanent easements, perpetual agreements.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDevlin had tried to buy the ferry from its former owner, Herbert Brown. But the negotiations failed, and Brown announced in December that he was shuttering the ferry, leaving hundreds of commuters without an efficient way to cross the Potomac and two communities without access to a prized landmark.\n\nDevlin speculated that Brown sold the establishment to a businessman instead simply out of \u201cspite.\u201d Brown said the Rockland owners \u201cdidn\u2019t want to sign a purchase agreement or go through the normal business procedures.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever make any progress with Rockland,\u201d said Brown, who admitted he was disheartened to give up something that had been a part of his family for so long. \u201cI think Mr. Kuhn can get it going again.\u201d\n\nThe contentious quarreling has exasperated locals, for whom the ferry is both necessary to transportation infrastructure and a childhood memory, a piece of the past preserved.\n\nThat history, most know, is intimately tied to the Confederacy. The name White\u2019s Ferry refers to Confederate Col. Elijah V. White, who, after the Civil War, purchased and renamed \u201cConrad\u2019s Ferry,\u201d which began operating in 1782.\n\nWhite named the vessel after Jubal A. Early, a Confederate general and an unabashed white supremacist. When the Brown family took over operations in 1946, they kept the name, which was painted on the ferry itself. When they acquired a new ferry in the 1980s, the moniker remained.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd those who boarded and disembarked on the Maryland side couldn\u2019t miss the massive bronze structure beside the dock: a 107-year-old statue of a Confederate soldier.\n\nLast summer, in the midst of the country\u2019s reckoning over the death of George Floyd, the statue was vandalized and toppled.\n\nThe Browns decided to replace one Confederate soldier\u2019s name with another, replacing the \u201cGen. Jubal A.

MPD is a microcosm of the society that we live in. We have to identify those things and root them out immediately,\u201d Contee said.\n\nAlthough the department does some have hiring safeguards in place, there is no written policy that specifically bars participation in or adopting behaviors of extremist or hate groups, Contee said. He said he wants to set out rules and make clear what behaviors could result in discipline or termination.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not okay for a police officer to be a member of a Nazi group, and we don\u2019t have any policy that says we can\u2019t be a member of such,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything specific that addresses these hate groups that prohibits hiring someone if we find they have posted on social media groups involving hate speech.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nContee stressed he is still working with city officials to determine what such an investigation will entail, especially given personal rights concerns of more than 3,700 employees. He said he also plans to contact the police union.\n\nContee said one way could be an examination of employees\u2019 social media. Another method, he said, could be requiring employees to sign annual statements agreeing to not participate in such behavior or risk discipline.\n\nThe acting chief acknowledged the challenges of relying on social media alone. Many groups on Facebook are \u201csecret,\u201d meaning they can be found only if a user is invited to join by an existing member. Others are \u201cclosed\u201d with content accessible only after an administrator of the private group approves a request to join. While most departments say they review social media posts during an officer\u2019s hiring process, the anonymous nature of social media and online privacy protections make identifying officers who have posted extremist comments or belong to such groups difficult.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd even before any examination, police would need to decide what types of behavior linked to extremist groups would warrant targeting. Would the department, for instance, cite extremist or hate groups as defined by the FBI, the Anti-Defamation League or the Southern Poverty Law Center? How would the department determine whether an employee\u2019s philosophies were aligned with any group?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the infancy stage. I can\u2019t tell you what it\u2019s going to take to get there. But at the end of the day, we want strong policy in place that would prohibit members of being involved in any behavior associated with extreme, violent or anti-government groups,\u201d Contee said. \u201cI want us to be the blueprint for law enforcement going forward.\u201d\n\nGreggory Pemberton, chairman of the D.C. police union, said he understood the need for such an investigation but said he was concerned about how it would be conducted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a bunch of Klansmen running around here. If we did, they would be found out pretty quickly. You can\u2019t hide those kind of things,\u201d he said.\n\nPemberton said he was concerned how the department would delve into employees\u2019 private lives and how officials would make judgments about what is found.\n\n\u201cI am concerned about personal rights and combing through people\u2019s lives. And how are they going to identify those people, and what is the process going to look like confirming what they think they found?\u201d Pemberton said. The union leader said Contee\u2019s \u201cintent is coming from a good place\u201d but added that the union needed to see more details.\n\nMichael Edison Hayden, a senior investigative reporter for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist and white supremacist groups, said groups such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers seek out members of law enforcement, active duty and retired, because they \u201cknow their way around firearms\u201d and they can read police tactics and help during demonstrations or other actions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHayden said police agencies need to \u201cmake sure these guys are not getting into police forces to begin with,\u201d which starts with thorough background checks. He said agencies also need to employ experts who understand signs, insignia and tattoos used by extremist groups.\n\n\u201cWe must push more aggressively, locally and federally, to give police the resources to identify who might be an extremist in the first place,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be McCarthy-like, looking at every meme they are posting, but it has to be more rigorous.\u201d\n\nPolice agencies already tread a delicate balance between protecting the free speech rights of officers and ensuring they meet general standards that call for honesty and integrity.\n\nAD\n\nChuck Wexler, who heads the D.C.-based Police Executive Research Forum, said the participation of some off-duty officers in the Capitol riot has forced departments nationwide to confront the possibility of extremists in their ranks.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is where this country is right now,\u201d Wexler said. \u201cThis is no longer a free-speech issue. It is an issue affecting the safety of Americans. Their right to express their First Amendment thoughts ended at the point they pushed over police officers and went into the U.S. Capitol.\u201d\n\nStill, Wexler said, it could be difficult for police chiefs to identify groups they do not want their officers to affiliate with. \u201cThe discussion is still evolving on what exactly constitutes a domestic terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLast fall, the Lafayette, Ind., police department said it terminated a recruit officer who participated in a neo-Nazi Internet chat forum.\n\nIn Columbus, Ohio, the police department has recently been sued four times by current or former Black officers alleging racism and discriminatory misconduct. The department, a spokesman said, does background checks looking for extremism in individuals who apply to become cadets, but such investigations are not done on existing officers.\n\nAD\n\nIn Washington, the department has seen its own challenges. Some residents have criticized officers in the department for what Black Lives Matter D.C calls overly aggressive policing of Black and Brown people.\n\nAD\n\nLast year, a 16-year police veteran filed a lawsuit in D.C. Superior Court, claiming the department retaliated against her after she raised concerns about the conduct of some supervisors, including allegations that officers had been instructed to conduct unlawful searches of groups of Black men. In a filing with the court, the city said the complaint was \u201cwithout sufficient information\u201d and therefore denied the claims.\n\nIn 2019, a 27-year veteran Black homicide detective alleged racism and ageism after he got into a violent scuffle with two White officers inside a Northwest D.C. police substation.\n\nAD\n\nAnd in 2017, a D.C. Superior Court judge dismissed a gun case against a man after defense attorneys expressed concern that the officers involved in the arrest were seen wearing a controversial T-shirt in the courthouse that depicted an image of the Grim Reaper with a pre-Christian style of cross embedded in a circle, a symbol that an advocacy group says is racist.\n\nContee said none of those incidents revealed evidence that the officers involved were linked to an extremist group. But he said such incidents could lead to a such perceptions among the public and among other officers.\n\n\u201cWe need to have an initiative in place, so we can emphatically say to the community we have something in form of policy that says what is unacceptable behavior and what is something that warrants discipline or even separation from the department,\u201d Contee said. \u201cI want the community to know this guy is going to be looking at things in this department through a different lens.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WTBX7DSXMII6XLGFSLJIDGQ4ZM.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.7794822454452515}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "After the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot , police leaders are under pressure to root out those with ties to extremist groups. \n\n Although the department does some have hiring safeguards in place , there is no written policy that specifically bars participation in or adopting behaviors of extremist or hate groups , Contee said."}, "category": "World"}, {"id": "7a4f62a1-2fc8-4344-81c3-a5c9276c4e83", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "Showing stingy Ivies how to become less selective but much better", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/ivy-league-admissions-low/2021/02/12/872c2622-6bb0-11eb-9ead-673168d5b874_story.html", "description": "Michael Crow reveals power of accessibility, depth and innovation", "published": "Sat, 13 Feb 2021 11:00:00 +0000", "body": "My first reaction to the new book Crow co-wrote with historian William B. Dabars, \u201cThe Fifth Wave: The Evolution of American Higher Education,\u201d was that this was a pipe dream. I receive many requests to write about visionary proposals. My response is: Get back to me when it\u2019s working in real schools.\n\nAD\n\nBut as president of one of our largest and most innovative universities, Arizona State, Crow has had some remarkable results. By this fall, the pandemic should be receding. Across the nation, students will be freed from more than a year\u2019s imprisonment with their parents. Amid those happy changes, offbeat ideas like Crow\u2019s might spread.\n\nAD\n\nIvy League schools earn their prestige mostly by admitting as small a portion of applicants as possible. This year, in part because of the suspension of entrance tests like the SAT or ACT, their admission rates are likely to plummet further. Applications to Harvard are up 42 percent this season, with its acceptance rate possibly going below four percent.\n\nMy solution to this stingy approach is to apply standard business practices. When companies have that much unfulfilled demand, they expand. Why don\u2019t our most prestigious colleges franchise themselves? We could have Princeton in Pittsburgh, Paducah and Pismo Beach, or Yale in Yakima, Yarmouth and Yreka.\n\nAD\n\nI\u2019m joking. As Crow and Dabars explain in their book, universities need to expand in ways that enhance not just the marketing of their brands, but their diversity, depth and innovation.\n\nCelebrated policy wonk Oren M. Cass breaks high school students into approximate fifths in his 2018 book, \u201cThe Once and Future Worker: A Vision for the Renewal of Work in America.\u201d One fifth fail to receive a diploma. One fifth get a diploma but do not proceed to college. One fifth enroll in college but don\u2019t graduate. One fifth complete some level of college but take a job that doesn\u2019t require a degree. Only the remaining one fifth realize the dream of graduating college and launching a career based on what they learned.\n\nAD\n\nCrow and Dabars argue that most universities are blowing their chance to give more students the knowledge and thinking skills that lead to professional success. \u201cMere access to standardized forms of instruction decoupled from discovery and knowledge production will not deliver desired societal outcomes,\u201d the authors said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCollege is not for everyone,\u201d they said, \u201cbut if our nation is to remain competitive in the global knowledge economy, our society must begin in earnest to build a higher education infrastructure proportionate to the task.\u201d The authors recommend more \u201cinteraction of students with scientists and scholars working on the frontiers of discovery.\u201d They also want \u201copportunities for lifelong learning to more than half the population.\u201d\n\nThat risks lower graduation rates. So universities, they said, will have to assume \u201cresponsibility for the success of each student\u201d and reconfigure \u201cthe delivery of content through adaptive learning and other technology-enabled strategies.\u201d Universities taking that approach \u201cwill likely scale up to include twice as many students as are currently enrolled, producing three to five times as many graduates, and serving more than ten times the number of engaged learners\u201d through online and other devices.\n\nYou may be thinking: yeah, sure. But Arizona State has some interesting data. From 2002 \u2014 when Crow took over \u2014 to 2019, non-White enrollment jumped 310 percent, from 11,487 to 47,104 (which is 39 percent of total students). The number of Black undergraduates went up 262 percent, the number of Hispanic undergraduates up 338 percent and the number of Asian undergraduates up 193 percent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe school\u2019s four-year graduation rate has risen from 28.4 to 53.9 percent during Crow\u2019s tenure, even though the number of students has soared. The university had about 38,000 undergraduates in 2002. In 2020, it had about 102,000.\n\nArizona State ranks sixth among 747 universities without medical schools in total research expenditures, ahead of Caltech, Princeton and Carnegie Mellon. It offers free online courses and transferrable credits to students in nearly every country in the world. It has cut deals with companies to enhance depth and relevance of instruction or, in the case of Starbucks, to offer tuition-free enrollment to employees.\n\nArizona State admits anyone who meets the requirements set by its regents. Since 2007 it has cut the time it takes to decide on an applicant from two weeks to 24 hours. Once students are admitted, the university helps them find financial aid and promises they will be able to afford to attend whatever their financial situation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpecial courses for new Arizona State students are designed to enhance their learning and study skills. Mentors recruited from the junior and senior classes are ready to help. Freshmen arriving with low SAT scores and high school grade point averages can take seminars to work on critical reasoning, reading, communication, emotional intelligence, teamwork and time management. One study showed the first-semester grade point averages of at-risk students at the school increased from 2.4 to 3.3.\n\nOnce the pandemic ends, students will again be meeting with advisers both in person and online. Adaptive courseware allows them to learn at different speeds. Data show the courseware increased success rates in math from 66 percent in 2009 to 85 percent in 2015.\n\nMost of this information comes from Arizona State.

Mighty, Howard\u2019s medical school dean, said.\n\nAD\n\nHoward and other historically Black colleges and universities have emerged as partners in the country\u2019s coronavirus rollout, serving not only as clinics for vaccines but also working to engender trust in the inoculations.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you look at the proportion of people of color who have died from the virus, it\u2019s been disproportionate,\u201d Mighty said. \u201cAs an HBCU who is connected to the community and has some trust in that community, we certainly try to make sure that we\u2019re paying attention.\u201d\n\nA similar effort is underway at Meharry Medical College in Nashville. In the past month, the school has vaccinated about 950 people in surrounding Davidson County. The school has also conducted clinical trials and administered coronavirus tests during the pandemic.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was important for us to do our part in participating in the clinical trials . . . so that when we got to the point of encouraging individuals of color to get the vaccine, we would have been there from the inception,\u201d said Cherae Farmer-Dixon, dean of the School of Dentistry at Meharry, who heads the university\u2019s vaccine clinic.\n\nFarmer-Dixon said that while distrust of the vaccine remains a constant, there has been an outpouring of interest from Black people who want to learn more about the shot and when they can get one. Now, the biggest hurdles are limited supply and a vaccination schedule that Farmer-Dixon worries is a mismatch for the community.\n\nAD\n\nNashville is inoculating residents ages 75 and older, but some of the greatest need is among younger Black and Latino people with preexisting conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, Farmer-Dixon said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou have to meet people where they are,\u201d Farmer-Dixon said. \u201cHave mobile vaccine sites, have pop-up vaccine sites in African American and Hispanic communities. The other part of that is partnering with people in those communities that people trust.\u201d\n\nMeharry is working with the city and state on those issues. Being a partner of the county health department in vaccine distribution means Meharry can directly voice concerns about disparities in distribution of the vaccine, Farmer-Dixon said. That\u2019s an invaluable position, she said, to get the community\u2019s needs met and further gain their trust.\n\nAD\n\nThe nation\u2019s four Black medical schools \u2014 Howard, Meharry, the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta and the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in California \u2014 are working together toward that end.\n\n\u201cThere is power in numbers,\u201d Farmer-Dixon said. \u201cTalking to and educating not only our immediate community but working with the three other Black medical schools so that we are all having the same conversations within our communities is important.\u201d\n\nThe push among HBCUs to support the vaccination effort has not been without challenges. Last fall, the presidents of Dillard and Xavier universities \u2014 two historically Black schools in Louisiana \u2014 encouraged their campuses to enroll in clinical vaccine trials in which they had participated. The backlash was swift.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSorry, not using my child as a guinea pig,\u201d one woman commented on Xavier\u2019s Facebook page. Skeptics also referenced Henrietta Lacks and the Tuskegee syphilis study \u2014 two medical cases that deepened distrust of health providers within the Black community. \u201cWhile I understand the necessity of a diverse pool of candidates to test the vaccine, why start with HBCUs?\u201d another person wrote.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI get the fear, but . . . we\u2019re dying disproportionately,\u201d Walter M. Kimbrough, president of Dillard, said in an interview last fall. \u201cWe\u2019re disproportionately hospitalized. We\u2019ve disproportionately lost our jobs. We\u2019re disproportionately impacted by this virus, so why wouldn\u2019t you do something that would protect you so you can go earn a living again?\u201d\n\nThis week, Kimbrough said some of the skepticism has died down as more prominent Black leaders have stepped up to build community confidence in the vaccine. The university\u2019s chief medical officer, for example, has shared information during the pandemic as an on-air contributor for a television station in New Orleans.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have more people like that who can speak to us where we are,\u201d Kimbrough, who is Black, said. \u201cWe need more trusted people who look like us who are doctors. We need way more people doing public health, the education part.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPresidents, including Wayne A.I. Frederick at Howard University and David Wilson from Morgan State University, have publicized their getting their vaccinations in hopes of sending the message to skeptics that the treatment is safe.\n\nBlack churches have teamed up with clinics to convince their congregations to take the vaccine. In a special aired on BET, actor, director and studio head Tyler Perry spoke to medical experts and received his shot on-air.\n\nAD\n\nPeople are warming up to the idea of getting their shots, but there is more work to do.\n\n\u201cLouisiana is just getting into the mass vaccination sites . . . and to have some in some spaces that are familiar with Black folks is good,\u201d Kimbrough said. \u201cWe have to keep doing these kinds of things.\u201d\n\nInclusivCare, a health-care provider in Louisiana, is in talks with Dillard to use the campus as a vaccination site. The university has already offered drive-through and walk-up testing for area residents.\n\nAD\n\nFlorida A&M University in Tallahassee is also preparing to assist in the state\u2019s vaccine rollout, Larry Robinson, the school\u2019s president, said at a recent event with other HBCU leaders. Encouraged by the success of the school\u2019s testing clinic \u2014 which has administered more than 250,000 tests since April \u2014 Robinson said the school also has a responsibility to ensure the community is vaccinated.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe really need to get the word out,\u201d Robinson said, adding that leaders at historically Black institutions have a \u201cmuch better chance of convincing folks in our communities to get vaccinated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf people don\u2019t come get vaccinated, then we\u2019re going to suffer unduly, and we\u2019ve seen the suffering already, the disparities, the death,\u201d he said.\n\nThat anxiety is what pushed Tasya Bracey, a 46-year-old chef from Bowie, Md., to get vaccinated on Howard\u2019s campus Thursday.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDeath is not fun,\u201d Bracey said, adding she has an 8-year-old daughter who needs her.\n\nBracey, one of 500 people to receive a dose of the Pfizer vaccine at Howard this week, said she did not hesitate to get inoculated. She was encouraged by friends who are doctors and vouched for the treatment.\n\nAD\n\nNow that she\u2019s finished with both doses, Bracey said she\u2019s not in a rush to go live her life like she did before the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to change,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m still going to have my mask on. I still won\u2019t hug my mom.\u201d\n\nMumbi Carter, 72, said she will also continue to wear a mask and avoid crowds. She received her final dose of the vaccine Thursday and is hopeful more people in her community will follow suit.\n\nCarter, from Suitland, Md., encouraged people to \u201clisten to the science.\u201d\n\nCarter\u2019s friend, 75-year-old Johnnie Harris, compared the vaccine to wearing a shield.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JYU6RTDMRUI6XJTO4JYEN2PITA.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9430370926856995}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "In the past month , the school has vaccinated about 950 people in surrounding Davidson County. \n\n AD \n\n Howard and other historically Black colleges and universities have emerged as partners in the country \u2019s coronavirus rollout , serving not only as clinics for vaccines but also working to engender trust in the inoculations."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "c791a10a-df78-4550-864b-58d843e15caa", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "Virginia\u2019s House and Senate pass competing state budget plans", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-house-senate-budget/2021/02/12/b6cf4ab4-6d4d-11eb-9f80-3d7646ce1bc0_story.html", "description": "The budgets boost teacher pay while addressing the ongoing pandemic.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 23:59:03 +0000", "body": "The budget bills also would fund low-cost business loans, housing aid and utility relief \u2014 financial lifelines for small businesses and individuals bearing the brunt of the crisis.\n\nBut with state revenue exceeding the dire projections made when the coronavirus first gripped Virginia, the House and Senate also found ways to boost pay for teachers, correctional workers, state employees and home health-care aides.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile we faced a national crisis, Virginia has been unique in that our revenues have remained positive and we\u2019ve been able to meet our central needs,\u201d said Del. Luke E. Torian (D-Prince William), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \u201cMy concern is that the true storm will arrive next year when federal funds have been diminished.\u201d\n\nWhile the two chambers will have to work out many differences before the bills can advance to the desk of Gov. Ralph Northam (D), the result is likely to be a spending plan that is more flush than anyone imagined even as recently two months ago.\n\nIn early December, when it was unclear whether the federal government could agree on coronavirus relief funds, Northam proposed a budget plan that set aside $90 million in state general funds for coronavirus vaccine doses. Since then, Congress and President Donald Trump approved more federal relief funds, allowing the state House and Senate to bankroll all or most of its vaccine with federal money \u2014 and use the state revenue elsewhere.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cVirginia legislators\u2019 and the governor\u2019s approach in the spring was to be extremely cautious because they didn\u2019t know where things were going,\u201d said Laura Goren, research director for the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a Richmond think tank that has analyzed all three budget plans. \u201cVirginia\u2019s economy, in part because of our dependence on federal spending, has not been hit as hard as some folks feared. So tax revenue certainly kept up better than expected.\u201d\n\nBoth chambers passed their plans on bipartisan votes, 68 to 30 in the House and 31 to 8 in the Senate. There was little debate, aside from a flare-up in the House related to the proposed elimination of the death penalty, noted in the budget because the policy change is projected to save the state money. In the upper chamber, Sen. Amanda F. Chase (R-Chesterfield) spoke against spending $50,000 to plan an otherwise privately funded memorial on state property to the Yvonne Miller, the first Black woman elected to Virginia\u2019s legislature. No one else objected.\n\nChase said Virginia, which took down many Confederate statues last year, needs a \u201ccooling-off period\u201d before it starts erecting new monuments.\n\nAfter the vote, House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah) said in a statement: \u201cThere are some laudable elements of this budget. But it falls woefully short of meeting our most pressing need \u2014 getting our K-12 kids back up to speed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGilbert introduced a floor amendment that called for public schools to offer an in-person instruction option for the 2021-2022 school year. It was set aside on a party-line vote, with Democrats promising to tackle that issue in legislation coming over the next few weeks. A week ago, Northam called on all schools in the state to offer some form of in-person learning by March 15.\n\nTucked in the Senate version is language requiring that all schools offer in-person instruction by July 1. Northam\u2019s budget and the House\u2019s do not include that provision, which Sen. Chap Petersen (D-Fairfax City) said the Senate will insist on.\n\n\u201cIn order to have a budget, the House is going to have to agree to our terms,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving Richmond without a mandate to reopen schools.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Senate version lines up with Northam\u2019s plan to give an additional $514 million to support K-12 schools, which have been struggling with remote learning, loss of students and other expenses related to the virus.\n\nAD\n\nEven temporary drops in enrollment could cost school systems money under state funding formulas, but Northam promised to keep districts whole. The Senate\u2019s plan follows that approach. But the House would reduce state support for that \u201cno loss\u201d protection to $400 million, using federal dollars and $30 million in anticipated gambling revenue to partially cover the cost.\n\nEarly last year, the General Assembly passed and Northam signed a two-year, $135 billion state budget. They would typically make adjustments a year later to reflect adjusted revenue forecasts.\n\nAD\n\nBut the economic shock brought on by the pandemic forced them to revamp the budget almost immediately upon passage, with Northam freezing new spending and calling the House and Senate into a special session to amend the budget that stretched from summer through fall.\n\nAD\n\nNortham restored some of that frozen funding in the budget he proposed in December. The House and Senate budgets passed Friday are amendments to his budget bill.\n\n\u201cThis is just an important milestone in what is a long process,\u201d said Sen. Janet D. Howell (D-Fairfax), chairwoman of the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cWe have miles to go before the budget is finalized.\u201d\n\nThe House includes $81 million for summer school and other forms of K-12 remediation, while the Senate includes $30 million.\n\nAD\n\nThe House and Senate offer more-generous pay to teachers and school staffers than Northam, who had provided $80 million for the state\u2019s share of a one-time 2 percent bonus. The House provides $231 million for a 5 percent raise, while the Senate budgets $140 million for a 3 percent raise.\n\nThe House and Senate plans also give bigger pay hikes to state workers, state-supported local employees and adjunct faculty members at state colleges. The governor calls for spending $98 million to cover a one-time $1,500 bonus for most state employees, a $750 bonus for adjunct faculty and a 1.5 percent bonus for state-supported local employees. The House plan would give them all a 3.5 percent raise and the Senate a 3 percent raise.\n\nAD\n\nThe House plan includes $7.5 million to give correctional workers a one-time $1,000 bonus, something not included in the Senate\u2019s budget or Northam\u2019s.\n\nAD\n\nIn higher education, the House and Senate agree with Northam\u2019s plan to restore $36 million to his \u201cG3\u201d initiative to waive community college tuition for people seeking job training in high-demand fields. The Senate version adds an extra $5 million for outreach efforts.\n\nLike the governor\u2019s plan, the House and Senate restore $30 million in need-based financial aid for in-state college students. The House and Senate tap millions in federal funding for colleges and universities to conduct coronavirus testing, something that was not available when Northam issued his budget plan. The House plan includes $35 million in federal funding and Senate includes $17 million.\n\nAD\n\nThe Senate, like Northam, would make a $650 million deposit into the state\u2019s reserve of cash to bring rainy-day accounts up to about 8 percent of the overall budget, a historically high level aimed at protecting Virginia\u2019s prized AAA bond rating. The House plan would go further, with a $780 million deposit.\n\nAD\n\nIn health care, the House includes $37 million and the Senate $67 million to boost wages for home health-care providers. Northam\u2019s plan does not raise their pay. The House includes $3.4 million to provide home health-care workers with paid sick leave, something the Senate and Northam do not fund.\n\nLike Northam, the House and Senate budgeted for various historical justice projects, such as memorializing the slave trade in Richmond, redesigning the city\u2019s Monument Avenue now that Confederate statues are gone or coming down, and commemorating a historic Black cemetery in D.C. that had its headstones dumped on property in Virginia. The House included $15 million for those efforts and the Senate $11 million, while Northam budgeted $25 million.\n\nAD\n\nThe House and Senate plans both include funds for a multiyear effort to legalize recreational marijuana, including the cost to oversee the industry and expunge records of certain marijuana-related convictions. The House sets aside $20 million for that while the Senate budgeted $35 million. Northam had budgeted $25 million.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZVWEI4DNMEI6XHVNM4YWRVNYOQ.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9889724850654602}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The budget bills also would fund low - cost business loans , housing aid and utility relief \u2014 financial lifelines for small businesses and individuals bearing the brunt of the crisis. \n\n In early December , when it was unclear whether the federal government could agree on coronavirus relief funds , Northam proposed a budget plan that set aside $ 90 million in state general funds for coronavirus vaccine doses."}, "category": "Business"}, {"id": "cb85c32d-605c-4c97-b728-c6434ce5c8df", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "S.

Roosevelt was still a first-term president when Mr. Blake, then 20, and his brother Curtis, 18 at the time, hung out their proverbial shingle in Springfield, Mass., in the summer of 1935.\n\nThey opened their ice cream parlor with a $547 loan from their parents \u2014 who wagered that with some industriousness and ingenuity the two young men could see themselves through the Great Depression \u2014 and the conviction that cheap sweets and cheerful service would keep the customers coming.\n\nAD\n\nTaking stock of their competition, which sold a double-dip cone for a dime, the Blake brothers decided to offer the same treat for a nickel. The gambit worked: Their first evening in business, according to the Springfield Republican, the line out the door kept them open until midnight, racking up sales of 552 cones for $27, plus change, in profits.\n\nAD\n\nIt was grueling work, with one brother making ice cream by night and the other scooping it by day. But if the stress wore on them, they aimed never to let it show, promising customers service worthy of the restaurant\u2019s name. (At the time it was known as Friendly; the \u201c\u2019s\u201d was added in 1989, by which time the chain was on its second corporate owner.)\n\n\u201cWe were friendly guys,\u201d Mr. Blake once told the Palm Beach Post. \u201cWe wanted to give the ice cream parlor a happy connotation to it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn 1940, they opened a second shop in West Springfield, Mass., adding diner food to the ice cream offerings \u2014 hamburgers to start, as well as grilled cheese sandwiches for the many Catholics in the neighborhood who abstained from meat on Fridays. (Ice cream on cereal, a Friendly experiment, proved less popular.)\n\nThe Friendly\u2019s milkshake known to generations as the Fribble was originally dubbed the Awful Awful, short, depending on the account, for some combination of awful(ly) big, awful(ly) thick and awful(ly) good. In 1950, Friendly ice cream parlors began offering the take-home ice cream that would later be sold by the gallons in grocery stores.\n\nAD\n\nBy the next year, the Blakes had 10 restaurants in Massachusetts and Connecticut, according to company history, and by 1974 there were 500 locations in New England and the Mid-Atlantic.\n\nAD\n\nAs they embarked on their business venture, the brothers flipped a coin to determine who would be president. Curtis prevailed. But as the operation grew, \u201cPres,\u201d as Mr. Blake was known, became the debt-averse chief executive, focusing on business matters as his brother tended to employee morale.\n\n\u201cWe worked very closely for 43 years,\u201d Mr. Blake told the Springfield Republican in 2019, when Curtis Blake died at 102. \u201cI counted on him to make important decisions.\u201d\n\nIn 1979, the Blakes sold their chain for more than $160 million to Hershey. Under that ownership, the chain grew to include 850 restaurants in 15 states. In 1988, Hershey sold the operation for $375 million to the Tennessee Restaurant Company, which took Friendly\u2019s public in 1997.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the early 2000s, dissatisfied with the direction of Friendly\u2019s and its dwindling stock price, Mr. Blake purchased a 12 percent stake in the company for $2 million \u2014 enough to be its largest shareholder.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got the fire in his belly,\u201d said Curtis Blake, who did not pursue active involvement in the company and publicly objected to his brother\u2019s battles with the corporate leadership. \u201cHe is going to step up and see what he can do. I\u2019m not needed.\u201d\n\nAmong other actions, Mr. Blake sued the chief executive, Donald Smith, over what he alleged was improper personal use of a company jet. Friendly\u2019s board of directors reportedly found no wrongdoing, and an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners, a private investment firm, acquired Friendly\u2019s in 2007 for $337 million.\n\nFriendly\u2019s subsequently underwent two rounds of bankruptcy proceedings, first in 2011, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, and then last year as the novel coronavirus pandemic ravaged the restaurant industry. Last month, Friendly\u2019s and its remaining 130 locations were sold to Amici Partners Group for a reported $1.9 million.\n\nStewart Prestley Blake was born in Jersey City on Nov. 26, 1914. His father became an executive at a clock-making company. His mother, a homemaker, brewed the syrup that was a key ingredient in early iterations of Friendly\u2019s coffee ice cream.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Blake briefly attended Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., before going into the ice cream business. The Blake brothers closed their operation when the United States entered World War II, displaying a sign promising that they would reopen \u201cwhen we win the war.\u201d\n\nThey shared their first automobile, a Model A Ford that they bought for $50, and nurtured a lifelong interest in cars. In another diversion, Mr. Blake financed the construction near his home in Somers, Conn., a replica of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Monticello estate.\n\nMr. Blake\u2019s marriages to Della Deming and Setsu Matsukata ended in divorce.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of 38 years, the former Helen Lindenmeier Davis of Stuart, Fla.; two children from his first marriage, Nancy Yanakakis of Coral Gables, Fla., and Benson Blake of Stonington, Conn.; a stepson from his second marriage, Naotaka Matsukata of Bethesda, Md.; three stepchildren from his third marriage, Paul Davis of Melbourne Beach, Fla., Mark Davis of Concord, Mass., and Susan Abello of Stuart; a sister; 16 grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren. A stepdaughter from his third marriage, Karen Davis Krzynowek, died in 2005.\n\nMr. Blake\u2019s philanthropy benefited universities and schools across New England, among other institutions and causes. He was the author, with Alan Farnham, of an autobiography, \u201cA Friendly Life.\u201d He continued dining at Friendly\u2019s until the end of his long life, and was partial to the coffee fribble.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/62W2HGDNJQI6XJTO4JYEN2PITA.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9872535467147827}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "AD \n\n In 1940 , they opened a second shop in West Springfield , Mass. , adding diner food to the ice cream offerings \u2014 hamburgers to start , as well as grilled cheese sandwiches for the many Catholics in the neighborhood who abstained from meat on Fridays (. \n\n AD \n\n By the next year , the Blakes had 10 restaurants in Massachusetts and Connecticut , according to company history , and by 1974 there were 500 locations in New England and the Mid - Atlantic."}, "category": "Business"}, {"id": "aacd489d-cce1-4a57-859d-e989861f8db1", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "CDC offers road map for safely reopening schools", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/cdc-school-reopen-guidelines/2021/02/12/43a1acb6-6cea-11eb-9ead-673168d5b874_story.html", "description": "The new guidelines say in-class learning is safe with precautions in place.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 23:20:00 +0000", "body": "The CDC cited a growing body of evidence that in-person schools can operate safely.\n\nAD\n\nEven if infection rates in the community are at their highest levels, as they are in some parts of the country, elementary schools can partially open, the agency says.

The Education Department released a handbook on operating schools during the pandemic, with practical examples and strategies.\n\nAD\n\nThe agency highlighted five mitigation strategies, saying they all help prevent virus transmission but are more effective if used together.\n\nMost important, the CDC said, is mandatory and proper use of masks for students, teachers and staffers. Walensky said that most school-based transmission has occurred when masks have not been worn.\n\nAD\n\nA second key strategy, the CDC says, is to maintain at least six feet of distance between people, to the greatest extent possible. To ensure this distance, the CDC recommends schools group students in cohorts to reduce the number of exposures.\n\nBut the CDC said that when community infection rates are lower, schools can reopen fully to all students, even if that means they will not be able to maintain six feet of distance. \u201cWe are worried people will not be able to get back to full in-person learning if we mandate six feet,\u201d Walensky said.\n\nAD\n\nThe agency cited three other key strategies: hand-washing, keeping facilities clean, and contact-tracing when exposures occur, combined with quarantining people who may have been exposed.\n\nAD\n\nNotably missing from this list was a strong recommendation to improve ventilation systems, a point of sharp debate, particularly in school districts with older facilities. The CDC mentions the value of opening doors and windows but does not discuss expensive upgrades that many have said are critical to mitigating transmission.\n\nIn its new guidelines, the CDC offered a color-coded rubric, based on community infection rates, to help systems determine what level of in-person learning is appropriate. But made clear some in-person schooling should be available even when rates are high, if mitigation strategies are in place.\n\nAD\n\nThe CDC recommends assessing transmission in the community based on the total number of cases per 100,000 people in the past week, and the percentage of tests that come back positive.\n\nAD\n\nBased on those two factors, the CDC classifies communities as in one of four color-coded zones.\n\nCommunities in the \u201cblue\u201d and \u201cyellow\u201d zones, those with the lowest levels of infection, can operate with full in-person learning, the agency said. The CDC recommended schools in the \u2018orange\u201d zone, with \u201csubstantial\u201d transmission, operate with reduced attendance, which could mean a hybrid system in which students are in school part of the time and at learning virtually the rest of the time.\n\nFinally, schools in \u201cred\u201d zones, the highest levels of transmission, can operate hybrid programs for all grades as long as they conduct screening tests for the virus. If they do not do this testing, the CDC suggests red-zone districts offer hybrid programs in elementary school and keep middle and high schools virtual only.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot every state will follow these guidelines. In Florida, schools were ordered to fully open last summer, and the state education department said Friday that Florida schools should remain fully open, even if CDC guidelines would suggest ratcheting back to a hybrid format, given infection rates.\n\n\u201cUnlike much of the nation, Florida\u2019s schools have been operating safely for in-person instruction since last August,\u201d Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran said in a statement.\n\nLike Trump before him, Biden has urged schools to reopen.\n\nUnlike Trump, Biden has repeatedly tempered his call with an emphasis on safety, careful not to stray too far from teachers unions, among his closest allies. He has said schools should not be expected to reopen until they have this guidance from the CDC and funding from Congress to implement the recommendations. He has asked for $130 billion for K-12 schools, and lawmakers appear set to deliver it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe question now is whether recommendations from the Biden administration will carry more weight with teachers and their unions, which have resisted returning in many places, and with parents \u2014 particularly parents of color \u2014 who believe it is too dangerous to return.\n\nBecky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest union, said teachers are likely to have more confidence now because of the new administration\u2019s commitment to follow science. Trump\u2019s push to reopen schools was embraced in GOP strongholds but was seen by many Democrats as driven by a desire to minimize the political impact of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI believe that the CDC has done their due diligence in following the science and reaching the conclusion that if schools put in place all of these mitigation factors and they have the resources, then it is safe to return to in-person learning,\u201d Pringle said.\n\nAD\n\nShe said she hopes school districts will work with teachers to study and implement these guidelines and said they will empower unions to demand that school systems fully implement the recommendations. Nonetheless, she said, some teachers may still resist a return to campuses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to make a blanket statement that teachers will go along,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will vary from place to place.\u201d\n\nSasha Pudelski, advocacy director for the AASA, which represents school superintendents, said she hopes the new guidelines will boost efforts of district leaders who are trying to reopen but running into resistance.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing this guidance can do is provide leverage to district leaders to convince teachers and parents to agree to in-person learning,\u201d she said.\n\nAlready, Pudelski said, the conversation is shifting from whether the CDC\u2019s reopening message is trustworthy to whether districts are properly implementing the agency\u2019s recommendations. That, she said, \u201cis a very different thing.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KL2F62DH6YI6XOVYOB7YO2OXQU.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9722408652305603}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The CDC cited a growing body of evidence that in - person schools can operate safely.

(Shallal\u2019s other restaurants, in more affluent parts of the city, already have outdoor dining.) He likened the moment to \u201canother grand opening.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou know, we need more of these kinds of places here in the east side of the river,\u201d Shallal said.\n\nAD\n\nStreateries have become a popular lifeline for restaurants at a time when indoor dining is severely restricted and offers increased risk of exposure to the virus. Last month, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) introduced legislation to extend the program into 2023.\n\nAt the time of that announcement, some business leaders pointed out that only one restaurant in Wards 7 \u2014 and none in Ward 8 \u2014 had set up a streatery, bringing renewed attention to concerns about equity in underserved neighborhoods.\n\nNow, there are two streatery options east of the Anacostia, a historic dividing line in the nation\u2019s capital: Sala Thai, on Minnesota Avenue NE, and the Anacostia Busboys and Poets where the outdoor tables are protected from traffic by a set of concrete barriers.\n\nAD\n\n\"All of a sudden, D.C. and a lot of cities are starting to feel a lot more European,\" Shallal said in an interview. \"The excitement of people sitting on the street, drinking coffee \u2014 [D.C.] is kind of late in the game. That's one silver lining of covid.\"\n\nShallal had grappled with how to offer outdoor dining at the Ward 8 restaurant.\n\nAD\n\nThe sidewalk previously featured a row of tables against its large windows \u2014 a setup that Shallal called unattractive for diners, who were forced to sit awkwardly close to pedestrians going nearby.\n\nJohn Falcicchio, Bowser\u2019s chief of staff and deputy mayor for economic development, said Shallal reached out in recent weeks to ask about obtaining the concrete barriers, which were provided by the city\u2019s Department of Transportation.\n\nAD\n\nShallal said local artist Shawn Perkins painted D.C.-themed murals on the barriers Thursday, making them more visible to motorists while boosting the dining area\u2019s ambiance. \u201cNo one wants to sit next to a piece of concrete,\u201d he said.\n\nFalcicchio announced Friday that D.C. businesses will be able to register online starting Saturday to receive care packages of personal protective equipment, including masks, hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes.\n\nAD\n\nAddressing the lack of streateries in Wards 7 and 8, Falcicchio emphasized the need for more dining options in the area. He said the city is recruiting shops and restaurants east of the river with a recent focus on two locations in Anacostia: the MLK Gateway and Maple View Flats development.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI do believe that this is an opportunity,\u201d said Kristina Noell, executive director of the Anacostia Business Improvement District. \u201cWe\u2019re really expecting to see [streateries] happen with additional businesses in the area.\u201d\n\nShallal said the Anacostia Busboys and Poets has maintained more revenue during the pandemic than any of the restaurant\u2019s other locations.

C.?\n\nPrivate indoor gatherings are capped at 10 people, with outdoor gatherings limited to 25. Restaurants must close at midnight, and alcohol sales are not allowed after 10 p.m. Indoor dining capacity is capped at 25 percent. Houses of worship can host services for up to 250 worshipers, if their venues are large enough.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nD.C. residents can shop in retail establishments and get haircuts and manicures as long as they wear masks when possible and the businesses follow various restrictions on crowd size and cleaning procedures.\n\nAre there enough hospital beds in the District?\n\nThe city\u2019s hospitals have remained under 90 percent full, except for one day in November and one day in December. In the event of a surge in cases, most hospitals can make room for cases beyond their normal capacity. Hospital leaders have said they are more worried about running out of nurses to care for all the patients than about running out of beds. That said, in December the District began \u201cwarming up\u201d the emergency hospital that it built in the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in the springtime. The field hospital has never been used, but it could accept patients in an emergency. Daily hospital bed statistics can be found here.\n\nHave any variants of the virus been found in the District?\n\nYes. On Thursday, Feb. 11, Health Director LaQuandra Nesbitt announced both the United Kingdom and the South African variants of the virus have been found in the city for the first time. Three people were confirmed to have the U.K. variant and one was confirmed to have the South African variant.\n\nHow can I get tested for the virus?\n\nMany of the tests conducted in D.C. each day happen at private doctor\u2019s offices, so if you have a primary care provider, calling your doctor is the best first step.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf you are looking for a free public testing location, D.C. offers tests every weekday and some weekends at firehouses and other walk-up and drive-through sites throughout the city. Check here to find out which testing sites are open on the day you are interested in visiting.\n\nCan I travel in and out of the city?\n\nYes. The District relaxed the rules for out-of-state travel. If you travel to another state, you are required to quarantine at your home upon returning until you can get a negative coronavirus test, generally three to five days after your trip. If you prefer not to get tested for the coronavirus, you should stay home for two weeks after traveling.\n\nAD\n\nIf you want to host visitors from outside the D.C. region, the District\u2019s rules require that your guests get a negative coronavirus test at home before they come here, and if they are staying for longer than three days, that they again get tested while they are in the District. They can use the city\u2019s public testing sites free.\n\nIs it safe to travel by airplane, train or bus?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending that people avoid travel if it\u2019s not necessary. As CDC epidemiologist Allison Walker says: \u201cThere\u2019s really no such thing as safe travel.\u201d\n\nExperts debate about the precise risk of air travel. While the rates of infection linked ty flying are relatively low, that low number is much more attributable to the lack of contact tracing to prove whether someone caught the virus on a plane or somewhere else, rather than the effectiveness of the ventilation systems on airplanes, researchers say.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat said, trains and buses do not have the same high-tech ventilation systems as planes. If you can drive in your personal car, rather than take a bus with others, consider that option instead. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a public health order requiring masks to be worn on planes and trains, train and subway stations, bus terminals and airports throughout the country.\n\nAre D.C. schools holding classes in person?\n\nYes. On Tuesday, Feb. 2, students and teachers returned to in-person learning at D.C. public schools. The school system had expected more than 9,000 of its 52,000 students to return to classrooms that day, but attendance was much lower, in part due to a two-hour delay because of snowy weather. The majority of charter school students remain in virtual learning.\n\nVarious safety measures have been put in place for returning students, including grouping them in cohorts of no more than 11 people and requiring masks and social distancing. Many teachers remain opposed to returning to the classroom in person; Washington Teachers\u2019 Union President Elizabeth Davis has told her members to show up for class if they can, and that the union would closely watch any safety complaints teachers made.\n\nDo I have to wear a mask in public in D.C.?\n\nYes. Bowser strengthened the mask requirement in July, requiring everyone over the age of 2 to wear a mask in all businesses, in offices where any other people are working, in taxis or public transit vehicles, in common spaces in apartment buildings and in crowded outdoor settings. \u201cPersons leaving their residences shall wear a mask when they are likely to come into contact with another person, such as being within six feet of another person for more than a fleeting time,\u201d the order says.\n\nIs it safe to eat in a restaurant, go shopping, hit the gym or attend a religious service?\n\nPublic health experts say any indoor spaces have higher transmission risks than being outdoors. Masking, social distancing and limited capacity can reduce the risk of transmission indoors, but it cannot eliminate it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe CDC recommends not visiting any of these places if you are feeling ill and to check in advance about mask policies.\n\nIs it safe to eat in a tent outdoors at a restaurant?\n\nThe risk of transmission depends on who else is in the tent with you. If it\u2019s a pod limited to only the diners in your household, your transmission risk is less than if multiple tables are seated inside the same sealed tent. Although outdoors, if the tent is closed off to the elements it could create poor ventilation akin to dining indoors. Experts recommend wearing your mask whenever not actively eating and drinking.\n\nHow is the city distributing vaccines?\n\nD.C. is vaccinating residents 65 and older, people and staff in congregate settings such as group homes and homeless shelters, and many groups of essential workers including firefighters, police officers, health-care workers, teachers and day-care workers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter that, a large group of people with certain chronic medical conditions and remaining high-priority workers such as grocery store workers will become eligible.\n\nSenior citizens can sign up for appointments at vaccinate.dc.gov or can call 855-363-0333 to make an appointment by phone. The city makes new appointments available every Thursday at 9 a.m. for residents of certain Zip codes, which are announced weekly, and every Friday at 9 a.m. for eligible residents citywide. Senior citizens in the District can also make a vaccine appointment through numerous health systems and nonprofit clinics, including Howard University, Sibley and George Washington University health systems; you can find links to those clinics\u2019 registration pages here.\n\nNesbitt said she is setting up a registration process that will soon allow the city to collect information about residents seeking the vaccine, then email them when it is their turn to sign up, based on their age, job and health status. The city also will look at whether they live in a neighborhood hard-hit by the virus and their date of registration.\n\nMore answers to questions about how the coronavirus vaccine is being distributed in the region can be found here.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/26BYQUDAHUI6XILXO5S7FGUVEQ.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9908334612846375}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Private indoor gatherings are capped at 10 people , with outdoor gatherings limited to 25. \n\n Have any variants of the virus been found in the District ?."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "98ad6ff6-bd00-4411-b091-c2213fa26b88", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "Kids are shooting hoops with rolled up socks, but pandemic physical education is not canceled", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/physical-education-classes-covid/2021/02/12/c31be1ce-6a7d-11eb-9f80-3d7646ce1bc0_story.html", "description": "Daily exercise may be even more important for kids\u2019 mental and physical health now than it was before covid.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 17:00:00 +0000", "body": "This is what remote physical education looks like in our house. And what it sounds like? Thundering footfalls from the bedroom above my office, as my third-grader runs through games her PE teacher is using as a warm-up.\n\nAD\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and the resulting widespread shift to remote learning have brought major changes to physical education. Games like Turkey Ninja Warrior and water-bottle bowling and solitary pursuits in spaces as small as a studio apartment have replaced class in open fields or gyms. Rolled-up socks and laundry baskets have replaced balls and nets.\n\nAD\n\nThe PE instructors I spoke with said the students seem to be having fun \u2014 the ones they can see on video, at least. Privacy policies in many districts bar teachers from requiring students to keep their cameras on, and some students don\u2019t.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to gauge whether they\u2019re getting the same benefits from online PE as they did from in-person classes. Some students lack the equipment, space or parental support to participate fully. Instructors say it\u2019s tough to teach and assess motor skills, like catching and kicking, online.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, public health experts say kids need exercise more than ever.\n\n\u201cPE is so important, because our kids are sitting from 8 to 3,\u201d said Michelle Huff, a high school PE teacher in New Jersey who has taken to posting TikTok videos inviting kids to join in on PE activities.\n\nAD\n\nIn a majority of districts, students are spending some or all of their school days online. They\u2019re missing out on recess and extracurricular sports, many of which have been canceled for safety reasons. Public health experts are worried about unhealthy eating, too.\n\nCompounding these issues, many students live in crowded apartments or in neighborhoods where it\u2019s not safe to exercise outside. In some cities, parks are closed because of the pandemic.\n\nIn places where schools remained closed through 2020, childhood obesity rates were predicted to climb by more than 2 percent, according to estimates in a recent study by a researcher at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nAD\n\nYet, even before covid-19 shut down schools, fewer than half the states set any minimum amount of time that students must participate in PE, according to the Society of Health and Physical Educators (SHAPE), which represents PE and health instructors.\n\nAD\n\nWith much of PE now online, some kids are getting even less time in class than before. Because of the pandemic, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) waived the state\u2019s time requirement in March, prompting some districts to eliminate PE as a stand-alone class or make it an elective. Portland, Ore., nearly laid off its elementary adaptive PE instructors, who work with children with disabilities, before teachers defeated the move. At least two Massachusetts districts have eliminated elementary PE altogether this year, according to the president of the state\u2019s SHAPE chapter.\n\nAdvocates for physical education fear more cuts could be coming, as districts grapple with looming budget cuts stemming from the current economic downturn. And if the Great Recession is any guide, those cuts could fall hardest on high-poverty districts, where students already have less access to after-school sports than in wealthier ones.\n\n\u201cNot all students have the privilege of taking ballet classes or sports clubs,\u201d said Julia Stevens, the president of Oregon\u2019s SHAPE chapter.\n\nFor now, though, PE instructors are focused on finding creative ways to keep their kids engaged. They\u2019re sending kindergartners on scavenger hunts that have them running around their homes to collect items. They\u2019re challenging high-schoolers to \u201cbeat the teacher\u201d by performing more push-ups in a minute than their instructor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disguising fitness,\u201d said Brett Fuller, the president of SHAPE\u2019s national board of directors, and a curriculum specialist for health and physical education in Milwaukee Public Schools.\n\nBecause most kids don\u2019t have a whole lot of gym gear in their homes, SHAPE\u2019s reopening guidance recommends that teachers ask students what they have on hand and provide a checklist of common household items that could be repurposed as sports equipment.\n\nSome substitutions are simple \u2014 cut plastic gallon milk cartons for catching, or unopened canned soup for weights. Others are trickier. Kyle Bragg, an elementary school PE instructor in Scottsdale, Ariz., said he\u2019s yet to find an acceptable alternative to a jump rope; nothing rotates at the same speed. He\u2019s told kids to ask their parents to buy one, but he can\u2019t force them. So for now, he\u2019s stuck with some students jumping over pillows.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like taking a pencil away from a classroom teacher,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly impossible to meet a jump rope standard without a jump rope.\u201d\n\nSome districts are purchasing take-home kits containing jump ropes, balls and beanbags. But the kits can be pricey, and not all districts can afford them.\n\nSome instructors are offering students choices: If they don\u2019t have the equipment they need for one activity \u2014 say soccer \u2014 they can try another, like running. The alternative might not target the same skills, but at least it gets them moving.\n\nAnd in the midst of a pandemic that has upended nearly every aspect of education, some standards may simply need to be set aside for a bit, instructors say.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou gotta be okay with okay,\u201d David Daum, an assistant professor of kinesiology at San Jose State University in California, said he tells teachers.\n\nAD\n\nThe hardest things to teach and evaluate online, instructors say, are the skills, strategies and collaboration involved in team sports. There\u2019s just no way to play soccer alone in your living room.\n\nThat\u2019s why online PE courses \u2014 which have existed at the high school and college levels since at least the late 1990s \u2014 have historically favored fitness-based instruction, like interval training, over the development of gross motor skills like kicking. Covid-era classes seem to be following the same trend, said Daum, who researches online PE.\n\nAD\n\nWhile some teachers have been asking students to send short video clips of themselves performing individual skills, like jumping rope, there are limitations and drawbacks to that approach: Some parents aren\u2019t comfortable with their children sharing videos of themselves, and some students send clips that are far too long. With dozens of students per grade, reviewing the submissions can take an instructor hours.\n\nAD\n\nThe alternative is to conduct assessments in live-stream classes, but that can open students up to ridicule and cyberbullying. Some districts have policies stating that students can\u2019t be required to keep their cameras on.\n\nIn such districts, it can be hard to tell whether students are participating at all. They might be doing jumping jacks, or they might be watching YouTube.\n\nAD\n\nTo gauge participation, many instructors are asking students to answer a question in a chat box or complete an exit ticket with questions about the lesson and their own performance. Some schools with fully asynchronous PE are relying on the honor system, with students using logs to report how much exercise they get each day.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many students are actually doing the portions of PE that aren\u2019t live-streamed. Are busy working parents enforcing it?\n\nAD\n\nDespite the challenges involved in remote learning, Fuller, SHAPE\u2019s president, sees the pandemic as an opportunity to show that PE is not only about team sports. Teachers are learning technological skills that \u201cnone of us ever dreamt they\u2019d have,\u201d he said. And students are discovering that fitness can be fun, even without group games.\n\nStill, many PE instructors said they\u2019re eager to return to the gym and sports fields.\n\n\u201cI became a PE teacher because I needed to keep moving,\u201d said Andrew VanDorick, an elementary PE teacher in Maryland. \u201cSitting on a couch in front of a computer may be some people\u2019s dream job, but it drives me crazy.

Their biggest cause for concern: the unknown future of transit after the pandemic and a bruised economy that has limited fare revenue and regional tax dollars that Metro relies upon.\n\nUltimately, members of the board\u2019s Finance Committee unanimously approved the bond sales proposal, a first step in its approval. The board also increased Metro\u2019s capital budget this fiscal year by $255 million because of a multiyear platform replacement project that transit officials expedited because of reduced ridership.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s the second time since June that Metro has sought to sell bonds to finance capital projects. While government agencies have done so for years, Metro\u2019s foray into the bond market was made possible after D.C., Maryland and Virginia made permanent in 2018 an annual dedication of capital project money for Metro.\n\nWith a reliable stream of money, the agency has sought to get hundreds of millions of dollars upfront to pay for the backlogged projects.\n\nThe bonds would be paid back over 25 years using the dedicated funding from jurisdictions served by Metro. The agency also sold $534 million in bonds over the summer.\n\nWhile the money will finance a slate of projects, most immediately it will be used to pay for new platforms at 20 stations with a price tag of $431 million. Because Metro moved up the project\u2019s timetable, the agency needs more money upfront to pay contractors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther projects include purchasing the latest model of rail car, replacing escalators and station lighting, buying 90 new buses and rolling out a mobile fare payment system and app.\n\nOver the next 10 years, Metro has projected it will need to spend $6.8 billion in modernization costs and nearly $16 billion to keep the transit system in what the agency calls a \u201cstate of good repair.\u201d While transit officials have spent the past six years reprioritizing safety over expansion and performance, Metro estimates it\u2019s still about $5 billion behind where it should be.\n\nWhile board members support the system improvements, some worried about going deeper into debt to complete them. The transit agency this fiscal year is operating using $1.3 billion from two federal coronavirus relief packages, and Metro officials say they believe it will need a third stimulus by the end of the year to bridge a more than $170 million budget gap.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMetro board member Michael Goldman suggested Thursday that Metro pause on the scheduled purchase of 100 buses and redeploy that money to Metro\u2019s platform project.\n\n\u201cWhile we all have a sense of euphoria and expectation and hope that Congress is going to enact this $30 billion in covid-related relief funding for transit . . . until that actually happens, I think we\u2019re running some risk here,\u201d he said.\n\nPausing on bus purchases, he said, would give Metro time to shift future purchases to more environmentally friendly electric buses.\n\nMetro Board Chairman Paul C. Smedberg said money from bond sales would not only help Metro keep up with maintenance but also take advantage of a period of low transit usage. The system would be better poised to help the region recover once the pandemic ends, he said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t we have platforms that are quite literally and figuratively crumbling?\u201d he asked Metro staff members. \u201cAren\u2019t there efficiencies in doing some of this work while ridership is low and in getting sort of ahead of this so we are ready when people do come back?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMetro Board Vice Chairwoman Stephanie Gidigbi Jenkins said she wanted to avoid limiting bus improvements. She said Metro should focus more on improving Metrobus, which is disproportionately used more by service workers and lower-income residents.\n\n\u201cMetrobus is a critical aspect for essential workers to be able to get to where they need to go to,\u201d she said. \u201cJust as much as we\u2019re raising the notion of \u2018state of good repair\u2019 as it relates to Metrorail, I hope that we will hold that same consideration as we talk about Metrobus.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOther board members said they worried about Metro\u2019s later capital needs if the transit agency used all of its credit in more recent years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the period from that point \u2014 \u201928 to \u201931 \u2014 where apparently we will have expended all of our dedicated funds,\u201d said board member and Loudoun County Supervisor Matthew F. Letourneau (R-Dulles). \u201cThen how do we fund the capital program? So we need to start thinking about that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe full board is expected to vote on the bond sale proposal this spring.\n\nBoard members on Thursday also heard updates on the completion of the long-delayed Silver Line extension to Dulles International Airport and Loudoun County.\n\nAD\n\nConstruction is being supervised by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which had estimated the project would be ready to hand over to Metro this spring. But Laura Mason, Metro\u2019s executive vice president of capital delivery, said Thursday that several construction issues remain unresolved or incomplete.\n\nThose include incorrect distances between insulated joints and signals, malfunctioning fans and station platform pavers that leak water. Mason on Thursday estimated the Silver Line would be complete in June, and then Metro would need five months to test the system.\n\nAD\n\nThe assessment, board members said, meant the extension would not be ready to operate until at least November \u2014 four months beyond the last tentative opening date the transit system had set for Phase 2.\n\n\u201cSo November 1 would be a reasonable day based on your schedule?\u201d Goldman asked. \u201cWhat I think I hear you saying is it could be a little earlier or it could be somewhat later.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H4WO2RDEZ4I6XOVYOB7YO2OXQU.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9952912330627441}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Board members were deciding whether to advance Metro \u2019s plan to sell $ 360 million in bonds this year to help pay for more than $ 22 billion in construction , replacement , expansion and renovation projects over the next decade. \n\n AD \n\n AD \n\n It \u2019s the second time since June that Metro has sought to sell bonds to finance capital projects."}, "category": "Business"}, {"id": "ac24f28e-723c-4318-8c86-f3fc21247ce6", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "South Africa and U.K. coronavirus variants detected in D.C.; Maryland to open third mass vaccination site", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/coronavirus-vaccine-dc-maryland-virginia/2021/02/11/d31a04ae-6c6a-11eb-ba56-d7e2c8defa31_story.html", "description": "Leaders in the Washington region continued to confront enormous demand for vaccine doses.", "published": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 22:47:00 +0000", "body": "Maryland earlier this month opened mass vaccination sites at Six Flags America in Prince George\u2019s County and at the Baltimore Convention Center Field Hospital.

Health Director LaQuandra Nesbitt had said she suspected the highly contagious variants already were circulating in the District. On Wednesday night, she got proof: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified three patients in the city with the variant first seen in the U.K. and one with the variant first identified in South Africa.\n\nAD\n\nThere might be many more, Nesbitt said, as only a small sample of all positive coronavirus tests are sequenced to detect variants. In many cases, a patient might never know which variant was contracted.\n\nLeaders in the District and Maryland on Thursday continued to confront enormous demand for vaccine doses from residents and from the pharmacies, clinics and health departments administering the shots.\n\nCounty health departments in Maryland have seen their allocations drop in recent weeks as the state siphons doses into its expanding network of vaccinators, frustrating local leaders, who are struggling to meet demand at public clinics. The Hogan administration has defended its decentralized system as critical to building an infrastructure that can ramp up when the federal government delivers more doses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo help assuage the concerns of local governments, Hogan said the state will offer a four-week guarantee of doses so public clinics can plan accordingly.\n\n\u201cThe basic problem is very simple: We need more damn vaccine,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cJust because you may be eligible does not mean that a vaccine or an appointment for a vaccine will be available to you.\u201d\n\nHogan said county health departments receive about one-third of the state\u2019s vaccine allotment. He said he considers their push for more vaccine an effort \u201cto monopolize\u201d doses, calling it an \u201cabsurd\u201d request.\n\nHe noted that although just 24 health departments and 80 hospitals initially were authorized to administer shots, there now are 2,300 \u201cpoints of access\u201d to get vaccinated across the state. Doses must be distributed throughout the network, he said, and not concentrated in health departments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe governor also announced Thursday that the state will provide 1 million coronavirus tests to public and private schools that offer in-person learning. Tests will be distributed based on the \u00adnumber of teachers, staff members and students participating in in-person instruction. Rapid antigen and the more-sensitive polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests will be available.\n\nHogan encouraged Maryland public school systems to reopen by March 1. Clinics throughout the state have prioritized vaccinations for teachers, although demand for shots far outpaces supply.\n\nHogan said progress in Maryland\u2019s vaccination campaign, which has distributed 753,000 first doses, has prompted him to decide that nursing homes without active outbreaks can resume in-person visits starting March 1, nearly a year after they were suspended.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, concerns continued to mount Thursday that the rush to vaccinate residents has unfairly favored the state\u2019s White residents, who have received a disproportionate number of vaccines, even though Black and Latino residents have been hit harder by the virus. Black people make up 31 percent of the state\u2019s population but have received just 15.2 percent of the vaccines, according to state data.\n\nHogan announced that each county needed to designate a liaison to work with the state\u2019s task force on vaccine equity, led by Brig. Gen. Janeen Birckhead of the Maryland National Guard.\n\nThursday marked the first day since the District started offering vaccine registration twice a week that every available appointment wasn\u2019t snatched up within minutes. The difference, Nesbitt said, was that this time the city reserved more than 1,000 of the 2,500 appointments for patients who called to sign up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPreviously, city officials drew from the same pool for both online registrations and those made over the phone. All online registrations were claimed Thursday morning, but appointments were still available by phone in the midafternoon.\n\nNesbitt said she worried that residents who had heard about long phone waits in the early days of vaccine registration were too discouraged to try calling in recent days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re creatures of learned behavior,\u201d she said, urging residents to keep trying to schedule a shot as the District works toward its goal of vaccinating 70 percent of the city\u2019s senior citizens by the end of the month.\n\nShe also noted a decline in the portion of residents answering contact tracers\u2019 phone calls, which has dropped below 70 percent for the first time since September.\n\nAD\n\nIn Montgomery County, officials emphasized Thursday that only residents in Category 1A and those 75 and older are eligible for vaccinations at county sites. Health officials said a \u201csignificant\u201d number of residents \u2014 including teachers \u2014 who did not fit into those categories have been turned away from county sites.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople need to follow the rules,\u201d County Executive Marc Elrich (D) said. \u201cIt is not orderly right now.\u201d\n\nElrich said the short supply of vaccine doses in the county and across the country means that it is important to focus on older residents, who are most vulnerable. He said about one-third of Montgomery residents at least 75 years old have received their first shot.\n\nAD\n\nMontgomery County Health Officer Travis Gayles noted that no vaccine doses are tossed out when people who signed up are turned away.

He is nominated in two categories for this year\u2019s Grammys, which will be awarded next month.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring the 1960s, Mr. Corea worked alongside such traditional jazz greats as Stan Getz, Woody Herman, Freddie Hubbard and Sarah Vaughan before exploring the more modern vistas of electronic music. When Davis, a trumpeter and mercurial force in jazz since the 1940s, started his rock-oriented \u201celectric\u201d band in the late 1960s, Mr. Corea joined as keyboardist and adapted to the new sound, experimenting with the Fender Rhodes piano and other electronic keyboard instruments. He performed on Davis\u2019s groundbreaking 1970 album \u201cBitches Brew\u201d and on other Davis electric outings, including \u201cFilles de Kilimanjaro\u201d and \u201cIn a Silent Way.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe inspired musicians to think for themselves,\u201d Mr. Corea said of Davis in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times. \u201cSometimes he\u2019d walk up to me and put his mouth next to my ear and whisper, \u2018Chick, you\u2019re nuts.\u2019 But he never fired us so he couldn\u2019t have hated it all that badly.\u201d\n\nMr. Corea extended that freedom of expression into his own musical ensembles. Throughout his career, he often had three or four working groups going at a time, jumping from electronic music to straight-ahead jazz duets and trios and small groups. He even performed piano concertos by Mozart and other classical composers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeginning in 1966, with his debut album \u201cTones for Joan\u2019s Bones,\u201d Mr. Corea recorded more than 100 albums and wrote hundreds of musical works, ranging from chamber music and symphonic compositions to several tunes that have become modern jazz standards, including \u201cSpain,\u201d \u201cLa Fiesta\u201d and \u201cArmando\u2019s Rhumba.\u201d\n\nBy 1972, Mr. Corea had left Davis to form Return to Forever, which emerged as one of the most popular and influential jazz fusion groups of the decade. At different times, the musicians included bassist Stanley Clarke, drummer Lenny White, guitarist Al Di Meola and singer Flora Purim, leading to a distinctive blend of rock, jazz and Brazilian music. The group\u2019s 1975 recording, \u201cNo Mystery,\u201d won Mr. Corea his first Grammy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d see young people at rock concerts standing to listen rather than sitting politely,\u201d Mr. Corea told jazz writer Marc Myers in a 2011 online interview, explaining his journey into electronic music. \u201cIt was a different vibe and more my generation. It got me interested in communicating that way. People were standing because they were emotionally caught up in what they were hearing. I related to that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, Mr. Corea never abandoned his earlier roots in straight-ahead jazz. While working on his electronic projects, which were sometimes scorned by skeptical jazz critics, he continued to perform on the standard acoustic piano, which he called \u201cthe most gorgeous and sophisticated percussion instrument ever conceived.\u201d\n\nHe released three albums of solo piano improvisations in the 1970s and began making intimate duet recordings with vibrapharpist Gary Burton, in a musical partnership that lasted decades. Two of Mr. Corea\u2019s recordings from the mid-1970s, \u201cThe Leprechaun\u201d and the double album \u201cMy Spanish Heart,\u201d expanded his popularity after Return to Forever dissolved in 1976.\n\nIn 1978, Mr. Corea joined forces with Herbie Hancock, another pianist who had worked with Davis and later became celebrated for his forays into electronic fusion. In a worldwide tour, they performed on acoustic grand pianos in programs that ranged from original compositions to tunes by George Gershwin and classical composer Bela Bartok.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThrough the 1980s, Mr. Corea remained a musical chameleon, adapting to almost any musical setting with ease. He formed a new group, called the Elektric Band, that offered a \u201cscintillating blend that draws almost equally from the Latin, classical, bop and jazz-rock fusion stylings,\u201d wrote San Diego Union-Tribune writer George Varga.\n\nSoon afterward, Mr. Corea formed the \u201cAkoustic Band\u201d with his Elektric Band rhythm mates \u2014 bassist John Patitucci and drummer Dave Weckl \u2014 to perform standard, unplugged jazz fare.\n\nIn 1984, he recorded a solo piano album called \u201cChildren\u2019s Songs,\u201d while also composing a work of chamber music, \u201cLyric Suite for Sextet.\u201d For all his musical adventures, Mr. Corea\u2019s favorite format was the traditional jazz trio.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a classic, put together for ways that I like to play,\u201d he told The Washington Post in 2006. \u201cIt\u2019s a small enough group that a lot of intimacy can go on during the performance, and a large enough group that you can make a lot of sound and do a lot of different things.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nArmando Anthony Corea was born June 12, 1941, in Chelsea, Mass. His mother was a homemaker, his father a Dixieland trumpeter who introduced him to music at an early age.\n\nMr. Corea, whose nickname evolved from an aunt who called him \u201cCheeky,\u201d began to study the piano at age 4. When he was about 16, he had his first major professional job, working for a week in Boston with Cab Calloway, a singer and showman who had been popular in the 1930s.\n\nAD\n\nAfter brief studies at Columbia University and the Juilliard School in New York, Mr. Corea embarked on a career in jazz, working early on with percussionists Mongo Santamaria and Willie Bobo, from whom he developed an abiding interest in the complex rhythms of Cuban and Latin American music.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always heard music, jazz especially, through the drums more than the piano,\u201d he said in 2001. \u201cI hear how the rhythm moves and how the motion goes, and how it dances, and what the groove feels like and the touch of it, before anything else happens.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe later had stints with Getz, Herbie Mann and Vaughan, while developing a \u201cmainstream jazz approach,\u201d in the words of jazz historian Ted Gioia, that \u201cboasted a clean, sharply articulated piano sound, a mix of modal and impressionist harmonies, and a driving on-to-of-the-beat rhythmic feel.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn 1968, Mr. Corea joined the Church of Scientology, which he credited with unlocking his creative impulses. He was one of the controversial church\u2019s best-known members and eventually settled near its headquarters in Clearwater, Fla.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of more than 40 years, singer and composer Gayle Moran; two children from an earlier marriage; and several grandchildren.\n\nMr. Corea toured constantly overseas and across North America. He observed his 60th and 70th birthdays at New York\u2019s Blue Note jazz club, he performed in multiple ensembles during almost monthlong engagements. He was honored as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 2006. His most recent album, \u201cChick Corea: Plays\u201d (2020) contains a typically eclectic collection of tunes, including works by Mozart, Scarlatti, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Thelonious Monk and Mr. Corea himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done two main things for years and years,\u201d he told the San Diego Union-Tribune in 2001. \u201cFirst, I follow my heart and imagination.

She established an institute that conducted classes, wrote a book on the practice, and became one of its chief exponents in the United States.\n\n\u201cWe are taking the birthing world by calm,\u201d Mrs. Mongan declared in 1999.\n\nMrs. Mongan\u2019s hypnobirthing program, which consists of in-person classes and audio recordings for pregnant women and their partners, includes breathing exercises, visualizations, music and positive affirmations that train women to drop into a deeply meditative, relaxed state when prompted with cues.\n\nAD\n\nThe program culminates at childbirth, when the woman channels her preparation to enter into a hyper-focused state of mind, akin to daydreaming, aiming to progress through labor peacefully, without pain medication or anesthesia.\n\nAD\n\nMrs. Mongan was influenced by the writings of Grantly Dick-Read, a British obstetrician credited with sparking the modern natural birth movement. Using his theories, she gave birth to her children naturally in the 1950s and early \u201960s.\n\n\u201cAnd this,\u201d she explained to the Philadelphia Inquirer years later, \u201cwas when women were totally anesthetized and the baby was delivered with forceps. I brought myself to such a totally relaxed state, without an aspirin or anything.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter a career that included stints as a teacher, women\u2019s college dean and secretarial school founder, she became certified in hypnotherapy in 1988. The next year, she created her first hypnobirthing program for her pregnant daughter, Maura. Her 1992 book, now titled \u201cHypnoBirthing: The Mongan Method,\u201d is in its fourth edition and has been translated into at least four languages.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPicture yourself gently resting on a bed of strawberry-colored mist that is about a foot and a half high,\u201d she wrote in the latest edition of the book. \u201cPicture the soft red mist as a mist of natural relaxation flowing through and around your body. Continue to relax until it seems that your body is almost weightless and seems to meld into the mist.\u201d\n\nIn 2000 she started the HypnoBirthing Institute (now HypnoBirthing International), which certifies doulas, midwives, doctors and laypeople to act as hypnobirthing educators.\n\nAD\n\nAlthough Mrs. Mongan believed everyone could be taught to bring themselves into an intensely relaxed state, and insisted hypnobirthing could dramatically reduce \u2014 if not eliminate \u2014 pain during childbirth, the science surrounding the technique is inconclusive.\n\nAnette Werner, a Danish midwifery researcher who studies hypnosis and childbirth, said randomized control trials, including her own, showed that while women who had training in self-hypnosis did not have lower pain levels or lower epidural use during labor, several of the trials found hypnosis had a positive impact on the childbirth experience.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMothers were also less likely to request C-section for future deliveries because hypnosis lessened their fear of childbirth,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nAD\n\nAt first dismissed by traditional doctors as a fringe idea, hypnobirthing has become a more mainstream birthing technique, practiced through a variety of methods.\n\nMrs. Mongan\u2019s program is taught at nearly a dozen hospital programs across the United States, and HypnoBirthing International, the practice\u2019s oldest and largest accreditation body, estimated that 250,000 couples take the online and in-person course globally each year.\n\n\u201cOur philosophy is to teach a woman to know and trust her body; her body will know how to do it,\u201d Mrs. Mongan told the Chicago Tribune in 2002. \u201cIt\u2019s more than a walk in a meadow or along the shore. It\u2019s bringing them to the deepest state. It isn\u2019t always pain free, but it is easier and more comfortable and more spiritual.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMarie Madeline Flanagan, nicknamed \u201cMickey,\u201d was born in San Diego on Feb. 1, 1933, and grew up mostly in Franklin, N.H. Her mother was a seamstress, and her father was a Navy chief petty officer.\n\nIn 1954, she married Gerald Bilodeau, a high school classmate. That same year, she graduated from what is now Plymouth State University in New Hampshire, where she also received a master\u2019s degree in education in 1971. She worked as an English teacher at her old high school in Franklin.\n\nShe recalled that when she became pregnant with her first child, in 1955, she refused to accept \u201cfolklore\u201d about pain as a rite of passage. Even her mother, she said, \u201calways told me how horrific childbirth was.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe we had a Creator with such a warped sense of humor that they would make us sexual beings and then make childbirth so agonizing,\u201d she told the Boston Globe.\n\nAD\n\nShe said she dove into literature on natural childbirth and gave birth four times during the next six years \u201cwith absolutely no pain whatsoever.\u201d\n\nShe and her husband divorced in 1966, and she married Eugene Mongan in 1970. He died in 2013. In addition to Geddes, of Bow, survivors include her three other children, Wayne Flanagan of Sunapee, N.H., Brian Kelly of Chichester, N.H., and Shawn Mongan of Epsom, N.H.; three stepchildren, Michelle Shoemaker of Weare, N.H., Steve Mongan of San Francisco and Nancy Kelley of Citrus Heights, Calif.; 17 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.\n\nAD\n\nFollowing the birth of her children, Mrs. Mongan continued her career in education. In 1965, she became dean of the now-defunct Pierce College for Women in Concord, N.H., and in 1973 opened the Thomas Secretarial School in Concord. The school, which she named after a friend, shuttered in the early 2000s.\n\nAD\n\nAfter becoming certified in hypnotherapy, she began helping clients quit smoking, lose weight and overcome their fear of flying. When Geddes announced her pregnancy in 1989, Mrs. Mongan decided to piece together her studies on relaxation, natural birth and hypnosis to create a program, which she taught in one of the classrooms of her secretarial school.\n\n\u201cI had a wonderful birth,\u201d Geddes said. \u201cMusic played, the lights were dim, and she kept saying, \u2018Relax, breathe, quiet your mind.\u2019 The nurses were all coming in because they would not believe how calm and relaxed I was, and the centimeters were just going up.\u201d\n\nOne of the nurses in attendance, who was pregnant and impressed with the techniques, asked Mrs. Mongan for an appointment to help with her birth. Over the next few years, as her work spread by word of mouth, Mrs. Mongan began training instructors and teaching expectant couples, wrote her book and set up a website.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1999, NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline\u201d ran a segment on a Florida obstetrician who used hypnosis on his patients. The next day, MSNBC wrote an accompanying story mentioning Mrs. Mongan\u2019s role in the practice, linking to her website. She began fielding questions from all over the world.\n\n\u201cWe received almost 5,000 calls and emails over the next few weeks,\u201d she wrote in the latest edition of her book. \u201cHypnoBirthing took on a life of its own, and in a very short time, it took over my life as well.\u201d\n\nStill, she added, doctors expressed skepticism and regarded the calm births they witnessed as \u201cflukes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn looking back now,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI must admit \u2014 the acceptance of HypnoBirthing didn\u2019t come the way I thought it would. It was a very steep uphill climb. A few times a doctor would inquire, \u2018What did you say this is?\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut Mrs. Mongan saw the practice gain popularity and acceptance. She spent the last 20 years of her life traveling around the world, teaching her program and advocating for the rights of mothers to give birth without excessive medical intervention.\n\n\u201cMy dream is that every woman will be able to bring a baby into the world calmly and gently,\u201d she told the Globe.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SXW3MQDLDYI6XJTO4JYEN2PITA.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.962704598903656}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "AD \n\n AD \n\n Hypnobirthing , which uses hypnosis to induce even greater calm during labor , remained in a state of prolonged infancy until the late 1980s , when Mrs. Mongan became certified in hypnotherapy. \n\n Mrs. Mongan \u2019s hypnobirthing program , which consists of in - person classes and audio recordings for pregnant women and their partners , includes breathing exercises , visualizations , music and positive affirmations that train women to drop into a deeply meditative , relaxed state when prompted with cues."}, "category": "World"}, {"id": "9676e439-9689-4070-921a-ca723b056890", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "Tiffany Shackelford, 46, was known as a unique, fun \u2018force\u2019 to friends, family", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/tiffany-shackelford/2021/02/10/2ef42f7c-67a0-11eb-8c64-9595888caa15_story.html", "description": "The media and design executive, who lived in Alexandria, died Dec. 27 of the coronavirus.", "published": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 11:00:00 +0000", "body": "After her death, her husband and son put some of her favorite items in the room where she did yoga.

Her mother was an artist and elementary school teacher and her father was in the Navy. They moved around when she was a child before settling in Fairfax County in the 1980s.\n\nAD\n\nShackelford graduated from West Potomac High School in 1992 and earned a degree in poetry four years later from East Carolina University.\n\nHer career mixed news publications with public policy, state politics and digital technology, according to her colleagues.\n\nShe started working as assistant managing editor of Stateline, a news site that covers trends in state politics, and she went on to become the chief strategy officer and communications director for the National Governors Association.\n\nAD\n\nShackelford was known for being \u201cpart tech geek, part journalist and part policy wonk,\u201d said her longtime friend Barb Rosewicz, the director of Fiscal 50, a project of the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t just specialize in just one,\u201d Rosewicz said. \u201cShe merged them and bridged those worlds.\u201d\n\nShackelford was involved in several professional organizations, including the Association of Alternative Newsmedia and the Online News Association. She helped found and later served as executive director of Capitolbeat, which provided training and support to statehouse editors and reporters.\n\nAD\n\nMost recently, Shackelford worked as executive director of the Society for News Design \u2014 a group for media professionals who work in graphic and Web design. Since last year, she also had been working on a project with the USC Annenberg School of Communication to teach state election officials how to improve cybersecurity.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe enjoyed connecting people and you could see her love in helping others,\u201d said Matt Mansfield, a partner at a D.C.-based consulting firm who worked with Shackelford and became a family friend.\n\n\u201cShe would talk to someone and they\u2019d say something they needed in their business and she\u2019d say, \u2018Oh, I know someone. Let me help you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShackelford was known for having a \u201csly smile, wrapped in a bawdy sense of humor,\u201d according to an online tribute.\n\nHer longtime friend Catherine Wigginton, 43, of D.C. said Shackelford was a natural storyteller who liked to drink bourbon and was known in her professional \u2014 and personal \u2014 lives for being \u201cfunny, irreverent, smart and outrageous.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe was just a force,\u201d Wigginton said.\n\nAfter her parents died, Shackelford made her close-knit group of friends her \u201cvillage,\u201d Wigginton said. She would invite friends for Thanksgiving and Easter dinners at her home, which is decorated with a mix of artwork by her mother and friends, plus a few posters of the Grateful Dead, one of her favorite bands. She would sometimes get guests to play croquet at Easter celebrations \u2014 a nod to one of her favorite movies, \u201cHeathers.\u201d\n\nShackelford met Castelo, a lobbyist, at a party, and the two married in 2006.\n\nHer friends and husband said Shackelford was happiest when she was talking about \u2014 or with \u2014 her son. She reveled in watching him learn and grow, and shared stories with friends of how he liked playing baseball, took up bass guitar lessons and was interested in history.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShackelford and Sam loved collecting seashells on walks at their family vacation home in Atlantic Beach, N.C.\n\n\u201cShe loved seeing who he was becoming,\u201d Wigginton said. \u201cShe was delighted by him.\u201d\n\nIn August, Shackelford was sick with cold-like symptoms and a fever, Castelo said. She tested negative for the coronavirus and so did her husband and their son. But then Shackelford got sick again.\n\nThree days before Christmas, her husband said Shackelford started to have \u201ccold-like symptoms\u201d and \u201cjust wasn\u2019t feeling good.\u201d On Christmas Day, she said she was tired and went back to bed. She had no fever.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t think it was covid,\u201d her husband said.\n\nAD\n\nShe developed a cough the day after Christmas, so the following day they planned to see a doctor. That morning, she went to take a shower. Castelo heard a \u201cloud noise\u201d and raced to find his wife had fallen.\n\nAD\n\nHe called 911 and paramedics arrived. She was taken to a hospital in cardiac arrest.\n\nEMTs told Castelo that she was stabilized and would soon be taken to the intensive care unit, but a doctor came in 15 minutes later and \u201ctold me she had died,\u201d Castelo said.\n\nHis first thought, he recalled, was: \u201cOh, my God. I\u2019m going to have to tell Sam.\u201d\n\nA friend had taken their son when Shackelford became ill. Castelo left the hospital, picked up his son and took him to a nearby garden area. He sat him on a bench and \u201cjust told him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Castelo said.\n\nCastelo soon tested positive for the coronavirus. His son tested negative. A babysitter took care of Sam in the family home while Castelo was in isolation, and the father and son used walkie-talkies to communicate.\n\nOf his wife\u2019s illness, Castelo said, \u201cwe have no idea how this happened.\u201d Other than running errands, they rarely left the house and never ate inside a restaurant during the pandemic. Both had been working from home and their son was in online schooling.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI have a hard time grasping how this was fatal for Tiffany and for me it felt like a bad sinus infection,\u201d Castelo said.\n\nHe continued: \u201cYou sit and watch the numbers on CNN at night,\u201d he said of coronavirus victims, \u201cand you think, \u2018That\u2019s other people.\u2019 We were doing everything we could to be safe.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt her memorial service, only nine people were allowed at St. Luke\u2019s Episcopal Church, the same place in Alexandria where her parents\u2019 funerals had been years ago. About 50 other people sat in their cars in the church\u2019s parking lot, listening to the service on a low-frequency radio station.\n\nHer husband read a speech he had found in their attic after Shackelford\u2019s death. She had written it after graduating from high school and read it to her church\u2019s congregation.\n\nShackelford had quoted from the song \u201cLife Is a Highway\u201d: \u201cLife\u2019s like a road that you travel on /When there\u2019s one day here and the next day gone. /Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand. /Sometimes you turn your back to the wind.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3EMQEPDKDAI6XJTO4JYEN2PITA.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9996774196624756}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "AD \n\n Shackelford was known for being \u201c part tech geek , part journalist and part policy wonk , \u201d said her longtime friend Barb Rosewicz , the director of Fiscal 50 , a project of the Pew Charitable Trusts. \n\n Her career mixed news publications with public policy , state politics and digital technology , according to her colleagues."}, "category": "Business"}, {"id": "75c0bbdb-1969-4a17-8325-e50d7df23990", "source": "washingtonpost", "data": {"title": "Virginia has seen more than 520,000 coronavirus cases.

The state had entered a third phase of Northam\u2019s pandemic plan in July, when cases were dropping. But after larger portions of the state became affected in a new surge, Northam (D) lowered the number of people allowed in gatherings, ordered restaurants to stop serving alcohol at 10 p.m. and lowered the age limit on his mandate for masks to be worn in public places to apply to anyone older than 5.\n\nNew daily reported cases and deaths in Virginia\n\nFor a detailed look at cases and deaths, see The Post\u2019s interactive map here.\n\nWhat are the current restrictions in Virginia?\n\nUnder Northam\u2019s \u201cmodified stay-at-home\u201d order, residents must stay at home between midnight and 5 a.m., except for those who are traveling for work, or getting medical attention or certain food items. Police will not stop anyone during those hours, however, since there is no enforcement mechanism. The limit on social gatherings decreased, from 25 people to 10 people. Those who are 5 or older must wear a mask when indoors in areas shared with other people as well as outdoors if they are within six feet of another person. Teleworking is strongly encouraged.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn late January, Northam also imposed new workplace health and safety standards for Virginia businesses during the pandemic. Among other things, those standards mandate personal levels of available protective equipment, routine sanitation, social distancing and infectious-disease preparedness and response plans to be drafted.\n\nThe orders accompany earlier restrictions set by Northam:\n\nRestaurants and other establishments can offer indoor dining but must stop selling alcohol at 10 p.m. and close by midnight. Entertainment venues can have as many as 250 people or 30 percent capacity, whichever is less. Retail stores can operate but must observe physical distancing requirements and enforce the state\u2019s mask mandate for employees and customers. Fitness centers and sports facilities can operate at 75 percent capacity, with a 25-person limit. Beauty salons, barbershops and spas can operate, but everyone must wear a mask. Recreational sports are allowed with a limit of 25 spectators per field for indoor sports, with spectators for outdoor sports limited at two per player. For marathons and other races, the crowd limit is 250 people.\n\nHave any of the variants of the virus been found in Virginia?\n\nYes. Both the B.1.1.7 variant, first discovered in the United Kingdom, and the B.1.351 variant, first discovered in South Africa, have been found in Virginia. The mutations appear to spread more easily than other variants of the virus, and there is some indication the United Kingdom variant could be more lethal. Available vaccines are thought to be effective against the variants.\n\nAre there enough hospital beds in Virginia?\n\nYes, though the number of hospitalized covid-19 patients has been steadily increasing since late October. Overall, Virginia has 16,476 beds available, or \u201cstaffed\u201d inside its hospitals, with plans to bring that number up to 19,771, if needed, by utilizing unused space on hospital campuses or even opening a treatment center elsewhere. You can find updated information on hospitalizations here.\n\nHow can I get tested for the virus?\n\nTesting locations change often, while local health departments and some private groups have been hosting pop-up testing sites for limited periods. The most up-to-date information on where to get a coronavirus test can be found here.\n\nCan I travel out of state?\n\nYes, but be mindful that some states have quarantine mandates for out-of-state travelers. For example, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut include Virginia on their lists of states whose infection rates are high enough to require a 10-day quarantine period. If you\u2019re traveling to other states, check with the state and local health departments to see if Virginia is on their list.\n\nIs it safe to travel by airplane, train or bus?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending that people avoid travel if it\u2019s not necessary. As CDC epidemiologist Allison Walker says: \u201cThere\u2019s really no such thing as safe travel.\u201d\n\nExperts debate about the precise risk of air travel. While the rates of infections linked to flying are relatively low, that is much more attributable to the lack of contact tracing to prove whether someone caught the virus on a plane or somewhere else, rather than the effectiveness of the ventilation systems on airplanes, researchers say.\n\nThat said, trains and buses do not have the same high-tech ventilation systems as planes. If you can drive in your personal car, rather than take a bus with others, consider that option instead. Meanwhile, the CDC has issued a public health order requiring masks to be worn on planes and trains, train and subway stations, bus terminals and airports throughout the country.\n\nAre schools in Virginia holding classes in person?\n\nVirginia\u2019s Phase 3 guidelines allow all students to receive \u201cin-person instruction \u2026 with social distancing measures in place.\u201d Some smaller school districts have allowed students back into the classroom, while some have chosen to go all virtual. Others have implemented hybrid learning curriculums that allow students inside a classroom on certain days of the week. The situation is fluid, so it\u2019d be good to keep in touch with your local school district for its latest policy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Northern Virginia, officials have set tentative plans to reopen, possibly after Feb. 16, after teachers and other began receiving vaccine doses and Northam recently said in-person instruction should at least be an option by mid-March. Parents are fiercely divided on the issue. Some applaud school officials\u2019 caution and say they would like to keep their children home for the foreseeable future. Others are demanding in-person instruction.\n\nWhile some students had returned for in-person instruction, mostly younger students and those enrolled in special-ed classes or career and technical classes, the surge in virus cases led many Northern Virginia school districts to reverse course. Loudoun County, which had returned about 18,000 children to school buildings, in mid-December suddenly announced it was returning all students to online learning, with schools Superintendent Eric Williams citing the \u201csafety and well-being\u201d of students and staff. Fairfax County also returned thousands of students to virtual learning in mid-December, as did Fauquier County.\n\nDo I have to wear a mask in public in Virginia?\n\nThose who are 5 and older must wear masks when indoors in areas shared with other people as well as outdoors if they are within six feet of another person.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nExemptions include eating or drinking in restaurants or taverns, exercising, a person seeking to communicate with a hearing-impaired person and anyone with a health condition that keeps them from wearing a face covering. Children older than 2 are strongly encouraged to wear a face covering when possible.\n\nEmployees inside essential business, such as a pharmacy or a restaurant, are also required to wear face coverings.\n\nViolations of the mask order are considered a Class 1 misdemeanor and are subject to jail time and fines of as much as $2,500. The state has begun to penalize local businesses that violate the requirement by suspending food permits and other business licenses.\n\nIs it safe to eat in a restaurant, go shopping, hit the gym or attend a religious service?\n\nPublic health experts say any indoor spaces have higher transmission risks than being outdoors. Masking, social distancing and limited capacity can reduce the risk of transmission indoors but cannot eliminate it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe CDC recommends not visiting any of these places if you are feeling ill and to check in advance about mask policies.\n\nIs it safe to eat in a tent outdoors at a restaurant?\n\nThe risk of transmission depends on who else is in the tent with you. If it\u2019s a pod limited to only the diners in your household, your transmission risk is less than if multiple tables are seated inside the same sealed tent. Although outdoors, the tent, if closed off to the elements, could create poor ventilation akin to dining indoors. Experts recommend wearing your mask whenever not actively eating and drinking.\n\nHow is Virginia distributing the vaccine?\n\nVirginia has received 1.6 million doses of vaccine, administering 70 percent of them so far. The state\u2019s vaccination process has been hampered by confusion after the pool of eligible recipients was expanded under what turned out to be a false expectation that the federal government would be providing those extra doses. The state\u2019s rate of inoculations briefly ranked near the bottom in the country before a push by Northam\u2019s administration brought that rate up to where most states are.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNortham recently announced policy changes meant to smoothen the process. Among them: The state health department is launching a single, statewide vaccination registration system on Tuesday, Feb. 16. Currently, vaccination appointments are done through county health departments, where the waitlists have been long due to the lack of vaccine doses. The state also changed its formula for distribution of vaccine doses to individual jurisdictions, basing it on their population instead of the demand for vaccines in each of those areas. That has caused frustration in Northern Virginia, where the demand for vaccines has been higher.\n\nHealth-care workers and residents of long-term care facilities were first to get the vaccine. Virginia is now offering doses to residents 65 and older along with some essential workers including health-care workers, teachers, firefighters, police officers and child-care workers, though the supply of doses for people in some of these categories is limited in certain jurisdictions.\n\nThe state\u2019s health department is also working with licensed vaccine providers to distribute doses, including pharmacy chains such as CVS and Walgreens or grocery store outlets like Food City. But confusion also surrounded the appointment process for CVS when it began accepting appointments on its online portal this week, with all 26,000 slots available for the week snapped up within a few hours after the pharmacy chain was unable to reserve them for elderly residents who had already registered for an appointment through their local health department.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNearly $40 million in federal Cares Act funds will go toward helping people who are uninsured or underinsured receive vaccines. Local health officials will be tasked with getting the vaccine to any non-federally recognized tribal communities.\n\nMore answers to questions about how the coronavirus vaccine is being distributed in the region can be found here.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GH6ZCBR6KQI6XNMLCYR7MJTZMA.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9948548078536987}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The limit on social gatherings decreased , from 25 people to 10 people.

Indoor capacity at restaurants, other businesses, gyms and religious organizations is capped at 50 percent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn-person visits to nursing homes have been limited to \u201ccompassion care\u201d visits only, and visitors will not be permitted without proof of a negative coronavirus test taken less than 72 hours prior. Hospital visitors are prohibited, save for a few exceptions that include end-of-life care, parents or guardians of children undergoing treatment, caregivers for people with disabilities and obstetrics. However, Hogan has announced that nursing homes without active outbreaks can begin in-person visits starting March 1.\n\nFans also are prohibited at professional and collegiate sporting events.\n\nStatewide, officials recommend no indoor social gatherings exceed 25 people. In most big counties, social gatherings are limited to 25 people outdoors or 10 people inside.\n\nAD\n\nSome of the state\u2019s most populous jurisdictions have taken restrictions further. Prince George\u2019s County has limited indoor dining to 25 percent, and lawmakers in Montgomery County voted Tuesday, Feb. 9 to lift a ban on indoor dining, beginning Sunday, Feb. 14 at 5 p.m. Diners will be limited to 90 minutes inside establishments, which will be capped at 25 percent capacity.\n\nAD\n\nAre there enough hospital beds in Maryland?\n\nSo far, yes. But hospital administrators and state officials are worried hospitals could become overwhelmed if the rate of infection does not abate. You can find updated stats on hospital bed usage here.\n\nHave any variants of the virus been found in Maryland?\n\nYes. Both the South African and United Kingdom variants of the virus have been found in the state. A couple from Anne Arundel County was found to have the United Kingdom variant in mid-January. On Saturday, Jan. 30, Hogan announced that a man in the Baltimore area was found to have the B.1.351 variant, a highly transmissible mutation of the coronavirus first found in South Africa. The man had not traveled out of the country, meaning that \u201ccommunity transmission\u201d of the variant was likely, according to Hogan\u2019s statement. On Tuesday, Feb. 2, Hogan said two Montgomery County residents who recently traveled abroad also tested positive for the same variant.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe mutations appears to spread more easily than the most common strain of the virus. While there is no evidence so far that the South African mutation is more lethal, the United Kingdom variant could be more lethal. Available vaccines are thought to be effective against the variants.\n\nMaryland is the second state in the country to report a confirmed case of the South African variant; on Thursday, Jan. 28, the variant was discovered in two cases in South Carolina.\n\nHow can I get tested for the virus?\n\nMaryland has a list of available test sites on its website.\n\nCan I travel out of state?\n\nMaryland\u2019s travel advisory discourages travel to any state where the case rate exceeds 20 infections per 100,000 residents. Maryland exceeds that threshold, as do all but handful of states.\n\nIs it safe to travel by airplane, train or bus?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending that people avoid travel if it\u2019s not necessary. As CDC epidemiologist Allison Walker says: \u201cThere\u2019s really no such thing as safe travel.\u201d\n\nExperts debate about the precise risk of air travel. While the rates of infection linked to flying are relatively low, that is much more attributable to the lack of contact tracing to prove whether someone caught the virus on a plane or somewhere else, rather than the effectiveness of the ventilation systems on airplanes, researchers say.\n\nThat said, trains and buses do not have the same high-tech ventilation systems as planes. If you can drive in your personal car, rather than take a bus with others, consider that option instead. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a public health order requiring masks to be worn on planes and trains, train and subway stations, bus terminals and airports throughout the country.\n\nAre schools in Maryland holding classes in person?\n\nMany are not, especially in the largest and most populous jurisdictions in central Maryland. Some public school districts in less populated areas and private schools throughout the state are teaching at least some in-person classes. But universities and some school districts are scaling back or canceling in-person instruction as coronavirus rates increase. Hogan and State Superintendent Karen Salmon have called for immediate efforts to return students to classrooms, at least part time, no later than March 1.\n\nDo I have to wear a mask in public in Maryland?\n\nResidents older than 5 must wear masks while indoors in public spaces and outdoors when social distancing is not possible, as well as on public transportation. See the governor\u2019s latest order here. Failing to wear a mask is a misdemeanor subject to a fine of up to $500.\n\nIs it safe to eat in a restaurant, go shopping, hit the gym or attend a religious service?\n\nPublic-health experts say any indoor spaces have higher transmission risks than being outdoors. Masking, social distancing and limited capacity can reduce the risk of transmission indoors, but it cannot eliminate it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe CDC recommends not visiting any of these places if you are feeling ill and to check in advance about mask policies. In Maryland, everyone over 5 is required to wear a mask indoors.\n\nIs it safe to eat in a tent outdoors at a restaurant?\n\nThe risk of transmission depends on who else is in the tent with you. If it\u2019s a pod limited to only the diners in your household, your transmission risk is less than if multiple tables are seated inside the same sealed tent. Although outdoors, if the tent is closed off to the elements it could create poor ventilation akin to dining indoors. Experts recommend wearing your mask whenever not actively eating and drinking.\n\nHow is Maryland distributing the vaccine?\n\nMaryland is vaccinating seniors 65 and older, along with teachers, firefighters, law enforcement officers, day-care providers and other essential workers. However, many Maryland health departments, including Montgomery County, have restricted appointments to those 75 and older and health-care workers as they struggle with limited supply. As of Jan. 25, 2.1 million people in Maryland are eligible for doses, but the state has received only 665,000 doses to give out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeverely immunocompromised people, such as those receiving chemotherapy, will be eligible for the vaccine beginning Feb. 1.\n\nHogan said the state is launching at least six mass vaccination centers, staffed by the state\u2019s National Guard, as well as deploy pharmacists at select Safeway and Rite Aid stores. The first mass vaccination and expanded pharmacy appointments began the week of Feb. 1, Hogan said. Mass vaccination sites at Six Flags America in Prince George\u2019s County and the Baltimore Convention Center \u2014 two hard-hit areas \u2014 opened Feb. 5. Appointments will begin at a third site \u2014 M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore \u2014 on Thursday, Feb. 25, while three more sites at locations in Western, Eastern and Southern Maryland will be added in March if the state has received enough vaccine from the federal government.\n\nMaryland residents who are eligible to get vaccinated can find a vaccination clinic here. (Those 65 and older in Montgomery can enter their details at this preregistration link, and when the county has more vaccine doses, they will invite those on this list to schedule appointments.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nResidents who are signed up for the state\u2019s emergency text alerts will get a text message each time the state starts vaccinating a new group. To sign up, send a text message to 898211 with the phrase \u201cMdReady.\u201d\n\nMore answers to questions about how the coronavirus vaccine is being distributed in the region can be found here.", "meta_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WHQKSDDCOII6XILXO5S7FGUVEQ.jpg&w=1440"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9952805042266846}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "AD \n\n AD \n\n In - person visits to nursing homes have been limited to \u201c compassion care \u201d visits only , and visitors will not be permitted without proof of a negative coronavirus test taken less than 72 hours prior.

Mr. Davis assisted Hayden in drafting the 1962 Port Huron Statement, the founding document of the SDS, and he remained a force on the political scene through the rest of that decade.\n\nWith his short hair and bookish glasses \u2014 a Washington Post reporter once described him as looking \u201cmore like a seminarian than a revolutionary\u201d \u2014 Mr. Davis appeared at least superficially to be an outlier among his more hirsute colleagues.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe son of a top economist in the Truman administration, he had grown up in the Washington suburbs and then on his family\u2019s chicken farm in rural Virginia, where, he boasted years later, he became the chicken-judging champion of the Middle Atlantic.\n\nHe turned to activism as a student in the late 1950s and early \u201960s at Oberlin College in Ohio, where he joined the SDS and initially occupied himself with efforts to bring about greater economic equality in poor communities.\n\n\u201cHe was profoundly committed to mobilizing people and very skilled at it, very articulate, very well-organized \u2014 an interesting combination of somebody who had oratorical skill and at the same time organizational smarts,\u201d said Todd Gitlin, a former SDS leader, professor at Columbia University and author of books including \u201cThe Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGitlin described Mr. Davis as \u201cvery personable and magnetic,\u201d someone who \u201crecruited supporters with ease.\u201d\n\nMr. Davis\u2019s interests gradually expanded to include marshaling opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Tensions over the conflict boiled over at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago as Vice President Hubert Humphrey defeated U.S. Sen. Eugene McCarthy (D-Minn.), who had campaigned on an antiwar platform, for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThousands of demonstrators had gathered in Chicago, where violent confrontations with police and the National Guard ensued. Mr. Davis recalled being struck in the head and knocked to the ground. \u201cI was on the ground crawling with my two arms trying to get away and just being clubbed and clubbed and clubbed,\u201d he told the Guardian newspaper of London years later.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA federal commission convened to review the incident described the events as tantamount to a \u201cpolice riot,\u201d with law enforcement officials responding in disproportionate fashion to the actions of protesters, some of whom were peaceful and some of whom were seeking to provoke.\n\nThe next year, Mr. Davis was among eight defendants \u2014 the others included Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, David Dellinger, Jerry Rubin, Lee Weiner, John Froines and Bobby Seale \u2014 indicted on charges stemming from a conspiracy to incite a riot. They were known initially as the Chicago Eight and became the Chicago Seven after the charges against Seale, a Black Panther leader, were moved to separate proceedings and eventually dropped.\n\n\u201cIn choosing the eight of us, the Government has lumped together all the strands of dissent in the sixties,\u201d Mr. Davis told the New York Times. \u201cWe respond by saying the movement of the past decade is on trial here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe dramatic, at times circuslike courtroom saga held national attention on the Chicago Seven for months. Five of the defendants, including Mr. Davis, were convicted of crossing state lines with the intent to incite a riot. They appealed, and in 1972 a court overturned the convictions in a decision that criticized conduct by the judge and the prosecutor.\n\nDecades later, the trial remains the subject of abiding public fascination. A film about the episode, \u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7,\u201d written and directed by Aaron Sorkin and featuring actor Alex Sharp as Mr. Davis, was released last year.\n\nAs the 1960s gave way to the \u201970s, Mr. Davis appeared to become increasingly militant, particularly in his opposition to the Vietnam War. In 1970 he told a gathering of Columbia students that if the 1960s had called for sit-ins, then the new decade demanded the burning of banks.\n\n\u201cIf this generation is to survive,\u201d he said, according to an account in the Times, \u201cit has to begin to fight.\u201d\n\nTraveling to communist North Vietnam, he later wrote, he \u201cstarted to feel like someone who had slipped into one of the American colonies from Great Britain to witness a small band of freedom fighters during our own country\u2019s war of independence.\u201d In 1971 he helped organize the May Day demonstrations in Washington, where protesters \u2014 thousands of whom were arrested \u2014 erected barricades throughout the District to voice their opposition to the war.\n\nTwo years later, Mr. Davis announced that he planned to forgo traditional activism and pursue a more just social order as a devotee of Guru Maharaj Ji, a 15-year-old Indian mystic who had cultivated an international following.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI would cross the planet on my hands and knees to touch his toe,\u201d Mr. Davis said in 1973, describing the guru\u2019s teachings as a \u201cpractical way to fulfill all the dreams of the movement of the early sixties and seventies.\u201d\n\nThe announcement prompted bewilderment among admirers as well as critics.\n\n\u201cIt was one thing for Tom Hayden to marry a well intentioned if slightly flat-headed movie star,\u201d journalist Nicholas von Hoffman wrote in The Post, referring to Hayden\u2019s marriage to actress Jane Fonda, \u201cor some of the other movement heavies to turn into the psychological basket cases a number have become.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cRennie,\u201d von Hoffman continued, \u201cwas the most stable, the calmest, the most enduring of that group of young people who set out to change America at the beginning of the 1960s.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nVon Hoffmann attributed Mr. Davis\u2019s conversion at least in part to the dissolution of the protesters who had once surrounded him.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn the spring of 1970, this generation believed it could overcome all,\u201d von Hoffman quoted Mr. Davis as saying, \u201cbut then came the summer . . . drift and no direction and by the fall of 1970 we really did lose the generation. The activists continued but after that it wasn\u2019t the same. People went into the country, they were into drugs and into themselves.\u201d\n\nRennard Cordon Davis was born in Lansing, Mich., on May 23, 1940. He attended high school in Clarke County, Va., where he was student body president, worked on the newspaper and yearbook, and played varsity basketball in addition to his activities with the 4-H club.\n\nAD\n\nHe graduated from Oberlin in 1962 and later received a master\u2019s degree in labor relations from the University of Illinois. At the start of his involvement with the SDS, he led the Economic Research and Action Project, an initiative that placed activists in low-income communities and sought to organize what they described as an \u201cinterracial movement of the poor.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMr. Davis\u2019s marriages to Luane Abend and Valerie Albicker ended in divorce.\n\nBesides Liegmann, whom he married in 2018, his survivors include a daughter from his first marriage, Lia Davis of Lakewood, Colo.; two children from his second marriage, Maya Davis of Boise, Idaho, and Sky Davis of Denver; a sister; two brothers; and two grandchildren.\n\nAD\n\nAt the time of his death, Mr. Davis was chairman of a foundation established, according to its website, to remake a human society that has become \u201ca wrecking ball to every natural living system\u201d and to forge \u201can unstoppable force for a new way of living on Earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cI try not to be reckless,\u201d he had told in The Post in 1971, \u201cand try to avoid confrontations that can lead to prison or death, but I\u2019ll never stop working. . . .

Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) at the Capitol when he was 7 years old. \u201cNow, we have the feeling of being occupied.\u201d\n\nThe heightened security measures are not going away anytime soon. More than 9,500 National Guard members from 19 states were on duty in D.C. on Wednesday, officials said. While that number will fall below 6,000 by mid-March, Gen. Daniel Hokanson, National Guard bureau chief, has said the Guard\u2019s presence in Washington is expected to endure.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has requested 500 locally based troops remain activated through March 12 for the upcoming impeachment trial of former president Donald Trump, President Biden\u2019s February speech to Congress and potential extremist activity March 4. Capitol Police on Thursday proposed permanent fencing around the Capitol and \u201cthe availability of ready, backup forces\u201d in proximity. The controversial recommendation immediately drew condemnation from D.C. officials and members of Congress.\n\nThis new militarized normal in the District, and in particular on Capitol Hill, has forced locals to interact with soldiers on a daily basis. Camouflage-clad troops are not only stationed at checkpoints along almost all major roads near federal buildings, but they have also become regulars at area pizza joints and coffee shops.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince arriving in D.C., Sgt. Travin Moore, an artillery crewman in the Kansas National Guard, has toured the Capitol building, stood underneath the Washington Monument and swung by Target for the essentials \u2014 workout sweats and a pair of headphones \u2014 when he has not been stationed outside the Library of Congress with an M4 rifle strapped across his chest. Thomas Warth, a lieutenant colonel also with the Kansas National Guard, sat outside Le Bon Caf\u00e9 on Second Street SE on Wednesday afternoon with a cup of coffee and a club sandwich.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been great neighbors, and we are just incredibly appreciative of them,\u201d said Patrick Savoy, a 34-year-old government consultant who lives on Capitol Hill.\n\nSavoy, like many who live on his block, said he was relieved when thousands of troops descended on his neighborhood in advance of Biden\u2019s inauguration. He had run through clusters of police cars and blaring sirens on Jan. 6 to pick up his 1-year-old son, Noah, from day care three miles from the Capitol. The armed guards made him feel protected.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor three weeks, Savoy has made a point to express his gratitude to the soldiers and police by bringing them bags of chips and drinks during his daily walks. On Monday night, Noah bounded toward officers at New Jersey Avenue and D street SE, clutching a blue Powerade bottle that rivaled him in height. He twisted his hand through a gap in the fence and waved at the officers, who crouched down and smiled.\n\n\u201cThank you, bud. We appreciate you,\u201d a Capitol Police officer said, taking the drink. She handed Noah a Capitol Police sticker to add to his jacket, which was already adorned with patches and pins from National Guard members and other Capitol Police officers.\n\nThe outpouring of support was so large that it created its own headache.\n\nWell-meaning citizens delivered food and set up online fundraisers after photos of troops sleeping in the Capitol went viral, prompting Guard officials to warn they were \u201cnot logistically able\u201d to accept donations and asked them to stop.\n\nNot all residents have been as comfortable with the military presence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMaurice Cook, executive director of Serve Your City and lead organizer for Ward 6 Mutual Aid, also lives and works on Capitol Hill.

We are people who are constantly asked to show up and clean up the mess, show up and fight in the wars, show up and pay our taxes, but our country has yet to show up for us to give us full voting rights and statehood,\u201d he said.\n\nPatrice Sulton, executive director of the D.C. Justice Lab, said the encampment around the Capitol may be chilling for people who are \u201cfearful and skeptical and cynical of the government having too much and showing so much power.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe want to protect our safety, but we also want to protect our liberties and our values,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen I think about that show of force, it\u2019s an indication of our failure to address our liberties.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nStill, many of the troops standing guard on Capitol Hill said they have rarely felt so appreciated for their service.\n\nWarth, who left his wife and three kids in Kansas for a now months-long stay in D.C., said he has seen locals offer his troops coffee and food. He said one person drove by a checkpoint with a stack of Starbucks gift cards.\n\n\u201cIt reminds me of the Shiite community in Baghdad when people would invite us in for tea,\u201d Warth said, recalling his deployment to Iraq from February 2007 to April 2008. \u201cThough it is sad to make those kinds of comparisons.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to snack and coffee runs, local establishments have staged a community-wide effort to provide free meals to the troops and officers around their neighborhood.\n\nWe, The Pizza, a restaurant on Capitol Hill, has raised more than $40,000 in donations to send meals to the soldiers after photos of the Guard members with their pizza boxes went viral in the wake of the insurrection.

Biren) reflects on her groundbreaking 1979 photo book \u2018Eye to Eye: Portraits of Lesbians.\u2019", "published": "Sat, 13 Feb 2021 12:00:55 +0000", "body": "JEB (Joan E. Biren) has self-identified as a radical lesbian feminist for years. A founding member of a collective of like-minded members called The Furies, she turned her passion for research and \u201cabsolute inability to find lesbian images\u201d into a quest for greater lesbian visibility. The desire to see not only herself but other lesbians, and to find historical connections to gay women, led her to produce photo books, direct documentaries, and tour the country with a now-legendary slide show between 1979 and 1985 called \u201cLesbian Images in Photography: 1850-the present,\u201d also known as the \u201cDyke Show.\u201d\n\nJEB\u2019s first book, Eye to Eye: Portraits of Lesbians, self-published in 1979, is now being re-released by Anthology Editions. It may be hard to conceive today of just how high the stakes were for her to publish a book of \u201cout lesbians\u201d more than four decades ago. The printer even made her acquire a second set of releases before it went to press, causing some of the subjects to lose their nerve. A 1979 article in Unicorn Times, an underground art newspaper published in Washington, D.C., places the moment into perspective:\n\nIt is almost impossible to publish photos of lesbian mothers with their children because of the mother\u2019s fears of losing their children in custody cases. Mothers are not the only lesbians who can\u2019t be photographed. Women afraid of losing their jobs, lesbians from other countries afraid of deportment, and lesbians afraid of disownment from their families all had to refuse Biren\u2019s permission to be published.\n\nAhead of the re-release of Eye to Eye, JEB spoke to TIME about the roots of her activism during her upbringing in Washington D.C., her years fighting to be seen and the joys of revisiting her archive.\n\nTIME: Can you tell me how your activism began?\n\nJEB: Both of my parents were civil servants. I wanted to go into politics through Congress to make policy. And I majored in political science. Then I came out as a lesbian, and that was in the \u201960s before there was a (gay rights) movement and I thought, that ended my political career as an elected official.\n\nIt was also the Vietnam War at a time when my father worked in the Pentagon. It caused a big split in our family because I was very antiwar. I went to England to study politics at Oxford University and spent most of my time working with people who were trying to get soldiers in the underground railroad\u2014deserters\u2014into a safe place in Scandinavia. I think that really what made me an activist was the Vietnam war and knowing that if I was going to affect politics and policy, it would be as an outsider, because I was a lesbian.\n\nWhen I came back from England I got involved with the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement. I was thrown out of my consciousness-raising group when my lover and I came out as lesbians. I spent a lot of time finding other lesbians. I found most of them at the Black Panther Party convention in Philadelphia. They were from New York, and I convinced a bunch to move to Washington, D.C. That was the beginning of a lesbian feminist movement here. We formed a collective called the Furies, and we published a newspaper where I first published my photographs.\n\nAlthough we were all white, I was told that because of my privileged education, even though I came from a very middle-class family, I knew how to argue verbally very well. I was told basically that I needed to shut up to make room for other people to speak. That is the genesis of my becoming a photographer.\n\nSelf Portrait with Sharon, circa 1970. \"I had never seen a picture of two women kissing and I wanted to see it\", wrote Biren in the introduction to 'Eye To Eye: Portraits of Lesbians.' \"That's my first lesbian photograph.\" JEB (Joan E. Biren)\n\nCan you tell me how your interest in the history of photography began?\n\nMy love of research and my absolute inability to find lesbian images led me to work to uncover what I believed were lesbian images. However, there was no book to go to. There was just mostly my gut feeling. It\u2019s very hard to feel like you don\u2019t have a history. Everyone wants to feel part of something larger than themselves. Gay and lesbian people particularly often get estranged from their blood families. So you\u2019re always looking for, \u201cWhere do you belong?\u201d At that time, there were very few histories, never mind visual histories.\n\nWhen I found these images, I was moved to share them with other people\u2014lesbians in particular\u2014and my friend Tee Corinne, who was a photographer, was traveling with a slideshow of erotic lesbian imagery. She encouraged me to do a slideshow too. Often at my slideshows, people would say, \u201cOh, my gosh, I had no idea that there were that many lesbians in this town,\u201d because it was the first time they had all come together for anything.\n\nI would do a workshop for photographers. I saw a lot of pictures of lesbians\u2019 cats, because people brought what they were photographing. But I also saw some amazing work. When I was in San Francisco, Del LaGrace Volcano came to a workshop of mine. A lot of people who came to my workshops were actually photography students who could not show the lesbian work they were doing in their schools. I think I served a real purpose of encouraging people to keep doing that work. If they were photographing lesbians and not their cats.\n\nJEB. Dyke, Virginia. 1975 JEB (Joan E. Biren)\n\nCan you kind of tell me about realizing you were starting to have a body of work, and that you wanted to make a book?\n\nThere weren\u2019t any books of lesbian photography that said that it was lesbians inside the book. And I needed it. Just like I needed that first lesbian photograph that I made, that turns out was a selfie\u2014I made by holding the camera out because I didn\u2019t even know anybody who could take a picture of me kissing my lover. And that wanting to see images of myself, I knew it was not just something that I felt. I knew all the lesbians who were beginning to be out felt that same hunger, as well as closeted lesbians.\n\nThe thing that made the book possible was that enough lesbians were willing and courageous enough to say they were lesbians and have their face in a book. That\u2019s why it happened when it happened. It could not have happened before then.\n\nIt feels like you had a lot of foresight in thinking about representation. The book opens up with a beautiful Black couple followed by all these different types of people. Could you talk about how that all came together?\n\nThat was a direct result of the politics that I had at the time. It wasn\u2019t just me. I was part of a political movement that was very focused on classism and racism. We were very conscious of the kinds of inequalities that existed in the society we were part of. And we were trying to do anti-racist work. And we were socialists.\n\nI worked very hard not to put out a book until I thought I had at least a fairly good representation. But you\u2019ll see in my dedication I wrote at the beginning of the book, \u201cMuch of what I would have liked to include is missing. Perhaps I should have subtitled the book Only Portraits and of Just a Very Few Lesbians.\u201d\n\n\"There is a disabled closet as well as a Lesbian closet. It was an easy transition for me to come out because I always had to be a strong woman.\" Connie Panzarino, New York City, 1979 JEB (Joan E. Biren)\n\nWhen I look at lesbian writers and Black lesbian writers like Audre Lorde, the conversation they were having about race and diversity seems so far ahead of the mainstream media culture. Was that the case?\n\nWe didn\u2019t have the word intersectionality back then, but we really did believe in intersectional politics. However, if you would ask this question of the Black lesbians in the \u201970s, like Barbara Smith, they would tell you the movement was still very white-dominated and not anti-racist enough.\n\nHowever, if you were listening to the Black women, as more and more people have learned to do today, then, yes, you would have a more progressive, more revolutionary politic that was more anti-racist. I think the lesbian movement that I was part of where we called ourselves radical lesbian feminists was more like that than you might have said was the lesbian movement in general.\n\nI do think that the lesbians at the time were more progressive than the gay men. We had less privilege. If you have a lot of privilege, you have to unlearn that. So as white people may have to unlearn their privilege, it was the same with the men, who had to unlearn the privilege they had because of sexism.\n\nAside from the photographs, you included lots of writing that you curated so carefully. Could you talk a little bit about the intention there?\n\nWell, the intention was not to just have it be my voice or my vision, my photographs, but to celebrate the lesbian culture that was beginning to be so amazing at that point. The lesbian poets\u2014Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich\u2014were the rock stars of the lesbian movement at that time. I wanted to share as much of that as I could.\n\nDarquita and Denyeta. Alexandria, Virginia. 1979 JEB (Joan E. Biren)\n\nWhat was the reaction like in the 1979? Do you remember people reviewing it or mailing it back to you?\n\nNot only did people not mail it back to me, but for years I would go into my local gay bookstore to their secondhand section. It was never there. Never! Today people are all telling me they still have the one they bought in 1979. I had to go immediately to print a Second Edition because the hunger for these is so immense. This book really filled the void, and the reception was amazing.\n\nI\u2019ve continued to hear all these years about how this book was a lifesaver. People would find it in bookstores and hide in the corner to look at it. This book made them feel not alone, not like a freak, not sick.\n\nI gave a copy to my college library (Mt. Holyoke), and it was stolen\u2014maybe like seven times. Eventually, they had to lock it up in the stacks, where they had this cage with all the rare books from the Middle Ages.\n\n\"For a Lesbian in this society there is plenty to feel angry or sad about. We don't have power. They can deny us the right to earn a living, to keep our children, to have a place to live, to be open about who we are. In order to survive you have to be aligned with men or be prepared to fight. Sometimes lesbians forget how hard the struggle is but it makes us all strong and it makes us grow.\" Lenora Trussell, Washington, D.C., 1977. JEB (Joan E. Biren)\n\nThat\u2019s amazing. I love that it\u2019s in the special section.\n\nThe reception exceeded my expectations. Even though I knew the hunger was there.\n\nThere is a new generation that has discovered your work for the first time. I definitely include myself, seeing your work in Aperture\u2019s Queer issue a few years ago. Why do you think it was left out of other history books?\n\nI think the reason you didn\u2019t know about it was that I never considered myself part of the art world. I was always part of the political world. Nobody knew who I was, and I took that for granted. I didn\u2019t expect anybody to know who I was outside of the community that I was making the work for. And honestly, I\u2019m just glad I lived this long to be able to see it.\n\nI knew in my heart that the work was going to be important as a documentary. When I was a young photographer, I saw Diana Davies and other people\u2019s work from the Civil Rights Movement of the \u201960s, displayed at the Smithsonian Institution. I said to myself, keep working. Someday you\u2019ll be dead, but your work\u2014when they recognize that the LGBTQ movement was important in the way that the Black Civil Rights Movement was being recognized\u2014your work will be in the Smithsonian. I lived to see that. I lived to see my work in the Smithsonian 10 feet tall on a pillar.\n\n\"In a bar if you're scared to meet people all you have to do it get to the pool table. Pool is a poetic game and it's one of the few games I play. I play pool and chess. I don't have time for games because I play games all day long. I sell office supplies. And I can't be Rusty in that store, I have to be Mary Ellen. Pool is always a way to relax and calm down.\" Rusty Slesinger, Washington, D.C., 1979. JEB (Joan E. Biren)\n\nWhite queer men have been given disproportionate attention in the history of photography. We\u2019re now in a reckoning that inspiring a reevaluation of history and who\u2019s told it, and that includes more women and people of color. I think your work is part of that reckoning.\n\nI had to fight for it. I actually fought for many years before I\u2019d gotten my work shown in the windows of the Leslie-Lohman Museum in New York. I walked into that museum and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have lesbians here?\u201d\n\nWhen Jonathan D. Katz did Hide/Seek at the National Portrait Gallery, I went to him and asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t I in this show?\u201d So, that took a certain amount of guts. And as a result of that, Jonathan Katz ended up curating a show called Lesbians Seeing Lesbians at Leslie-Lohman. But only because I complained, I think.\n\n\"There is all this intimidating stuff around cars, because cars represent the power of being able to cope and get around in the world. If you know how to do that, you begin to realize how much more you can do. You can do anything you want.\" Valerie Mullen and Lori. Washington, D.C., 1978. JEB (Joan E. Biren)\n\nI think that\u2019s so brave. A lot of photographers are afraid to rock the boat. But you really fought for your work.\n\nWell, the reason is that I never thought of it as me, the artist. I always thought of it as lesbian representation is not happening in a place where it should be happening. And I continue to fight for representation of other lesbian photographers who I feel are not being given the recognition they deserve also.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you put your full name on the cover of the book? Why did you go with the acronym JEB?\n\nI adapted that acronym in the beginning because I believed that if I had a short name, people would give me credit. Because I was just publishing in newspapers and magazines.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I pulled my initials out of a cereal box with these little stick-on letters and put them on my bike. And I liked how it looked, and I thought it sounded butchier, too. So for those reasons, I chose to be JEB in my photography life. And now I\u2019m trying to bring the two names together.\n\n\"When we moved into this house together, Pagan had been doing cooking for her family for twenty-five years and so she wouldn't cook at all. I cooked the first dinner and the frozen vegetables were still icy when we bit into them. 'Tastes fine to me,' she said,\" says Kady. Pagan and Kady. Monticello, New York, 1987 JEB (Joan E. Biren)\n\nIn revisiting the work to republish the book, were there any new discoveries? Did anything surprising happen along the way?\n\nWe started with the idea that we would just republish the exact volume. Along the way, we added a couple of new essays to place it in a context. But we went back to the film negatives with the advances in scanning technology. The thing that I discovered was that when I made these photographs, I was incredibly self-critical and full of doubt about my ability as a photographer.\n\nWhen you\u2019re self-taught, you are always going to doubt whether you\u2019re doing it the right way. I had gained some confidence in the 40-plus years since then, and when I went back with my today eyes, I thought to myself, \u201cHey, these aren\u2019t bad!\u201d I liked my own work in a way now that I did not then.\n\nWhat is it like to see the book kind of reborn?\n\nThe thing that excites me about it the most is that it will be available to younger generations of lesbians and people because it\u2019s going to be on a wider stage now. People besides this rather small lesbian community that existed in the 1970s are going to be able to hear about it, and that\u2019s just amazing to me.\n\nSpotts. Washington, DC. 1977 JEB (Joan E.

The former head of the European Central Bank, affectionately dubbed \u201cSuper Mario\u201d by the press, is a skilled political operator hailed for almost single-handedly rescuing the Euro currency in the depths of the Eurozone crisis. But he faces his greatest test yet in getting Italy\u2019s politics and economics back on track.\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\nItaly is the Eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy (behind only Germany and France), but the influence its economic heft should afford it in E.U. policymaking is undermined by perpetual economic and political dysfunction. The one constant of Italian politics since World War II is the country\u2019s struggles to keep its coalition governments together; the last few years have been no different, as subsequent governments (first between the anti-Establishment M5S and far-right Lega, then between M5S and the center-left Partito Democratico and Italia Viva parties) have collapsed. This latest coalition fell apart over disagreements over how to distribute more than \u20ac200 billion worth of funds earmarked for the country from the E.U.\u2019s coronavirus Recovery Fund. It\u2019s not just a question of divvying up the money according to political priorities; accessing the full amount of funds available requires serious (and painful) structural reform.\n\nSergio Mattarella, the country\u2019s president, tried to get Italy\u2019s political parties to reach a compromise to form a new government, but when that failed, he made the surprise decision to charge Mario Draghi with the task of forming a new government to avoid a new election in the midst of the pandemic. That gave way to relief as Draghi commenced talks with all the parties; Draghi\u2019s unique stature makes him well liked by the Italian populace (70%+ approval rating), and his competence has most every party in parliament willing to support him in these early days. It also helps that most parties are wary of returning to elections, as the pandemic has upended the country and with it their political calculations. Plenty of politicians in Rome are willing to take the stability that a Draghi government represents in the interim, especially as the country needs to hold elections no later than spring of 2023.\n\nItaly has often had to cycle through technocratic governments as a stop-gap measure between elections. But there are a few things going in Draghi\u2019s favor. First, he doesn\u2019t have to implement austerity measures like previous technocratic Italian governments were forced to do (indeed, it\u2019s the opposite given the Recovery Fund and low rates for borrowing), he commands an incredible amount of respect abroad and at home, and he\u2019s a technocrat who has wrangled with both Italian and Brussels politics for decades and knows how to play the game, something other technocratic prime ministers have struggled with. Second, he also is rumored to be a frontrunner to replace Mattarella as president of the country next year when Mattarella\u2019s term is set to expire, which means that he doesn\u2019t represent that much of a political threat to the future aspirations of other party leaders\u2014this is an emergency situation, and Draghi is being called in for a short amount of time to help set Italy on a sustainable path. As of this writing, it\u2019s looking like technocrats and major politicos will form the cabinet, but the most critical ministries are likely to go to technocrats\u2014finance, foreign affairs, justice and interior.\n\nWhat Happens Next:\n\nDraghi\u2019s immediate priority is the pandemic. Italy doesn\u2019t have much ability to speed up or change vaccination rollout plans (something E.U. countries ceded to Brussels, for better or worse), but he will have to decide whether to extend the country\u2019s lockdown which is scheduled to expire in a few weeks. He also will be tasked with figuring out if and how to extend economic support for the Italian people to keep them afloat through the next phase of the pandemic (i.e. more stimulus for families and businesses).\n\nThen comes the hard part\u2014figuring out how to structure and disburse the stimulus windfall coming Rome\u2019s way. All told, nearly \u20ac209 billion will be made available to Italy in a mixture of loans and grants, but getting the full amount depends on Brussels signing off on Italy\u2019s reforms. So what will those reforms entail? Italy has plenty to fix, but on the list are: transitioning to a more green economy, building better infrastructure, upgrading and digitizing many public functions of the state, cutting down bureaucracy, implementing tax reforms to help workers (and getting more of them back into the labor market), judicial reforms to make civil trials shorter, and broad education reforms. Not on the list? Reforming Italy\u2019s byzantine electoral system, something that has been on Rome\u2019s to-do list for years.\n\nBut the reality is that all these reforms will be very tricky to pull off, even with billions suddenly available and someone like Draghi leading the charge. And that\u2019s because the Italian political landscape is as fragmented as ever, and many of the parties diametrically opposed on policy priorities. Everyone is supporting Draghi now, but that\u2019s because it costs nothing to do so and he\u2019s said nothing publicly about what his reforms will be. Once proposals are in the open, that\u2019s when the knives will come out. Historically, the first 6 to 12 months are crucial for technocratic governments in getting their goals accomplished. Which means the clock starts ticking as soon as a vote of confidence is held to install the new government.\n\nThe Key Quote That Sums It All Up:\n\nMatteo Renzi, former Prime Minister of Italy and the person who triggered the collapse of the previous government by pulling his Italia Viva party out of the coalition: \u201cThe only way in the middle of a pandemic was to call in the best player, because Mario is the best player\u2026 If you look at financial markets, international leaders, the confidence of our citizens, it is a miracle.\u201d\n\nBut confidence can be a fickle thing. You know who knows that well? Mario Draghi.\n\nThe One Thing to Read About It:\n\nUsually, the arrival of a new Italian Prime Minister doesn\u2019t fundamentally change political calculations in Brussels. But Draghi looks likely to buck that trend. Why? Read this excellent piece by my Eurasia Group colleague Mij Rahman to find out.\n\nThe One Thing to Say About It on a Zoom Call:\n\nSuper Mario has just entered the final boss stage of his career\u2014keeping Italy afloat during a pandemic while also putting it on a sustainable track forward. If he pulls this off, Draghi will go down as one of the greatest non-elected political figures in modern European history.\n\nThe One Thing to Avoid Saying About It on a Zoom Call:\n\nItalian governments have been paralyzed in the past for having to make deep austerity cuts; now they\u2019re paralyzed for the exact opposite reason. If Italy can\u2019t figure this one out\u2026\n\nSign up for Inside TIME. Be the first to see the new cover of TIME and get our most compelling stories delivered straight to your inbox.

The film follows Jacob (Steven Yeun) as he starts a family farm in Arkansas and navigates horticultural and personal crises; it won the audience award at Sundance last year and, more recently, was nominated for three SAG Awards, including for the performance of its ensemble cast. In between those accolades, Minari, which arrives in theaters Feb. 12 and on demand Feb. 26, has received acclaim for the way it tackles universal themes like isolation, aspiration and generational divides.\n\nBut while Chung has successfully won over a wider audience, his story is also resonating particularly deeply with its subjects: Korean-American farmers and their families. While Chung initially believed his life story to be unique, farming is deeply entwined with the Korean-American experience. \u201cIn the early 1900s, farming provided the foundation for the Korean immigrant economy,\u201d Richard Kim, a professor of Asian American Studies at the University of California, Davis, says. \u201cAgriculture was really the only viable form of livelihood for many Asian immigrants during this time period.\u201d\n\nAnd although most of the Korean immigrants who arrived following the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act went into other fields, there are nonetheless many Korean-American farmers who acutely recognize the experiences portrayed in Minari\u2014and until this point, had never seen themselves reflected onscreen with such specificity. \u201cIt feels so close to our story that I can\u2019t believe someone made a movie about this,\u201d Joseph Chong, who grew up on a California family farm in the \u201870s and 80s, says.\n\nBefore the film\u2019s release, TIME asked several Korean-American farmers to watch the film and reflect on the aspects of it that resonated. Here are their stories, and the history that paved the way for them.\n\nFrom left, Steven Yeun, Alan S. Kim, Yuh-Jung Youn, Yeri Han, Noel Cho in \"Minari.\" Josh Ethan Johnson\u2014A24\n\nThe First Wave\n\nWhile the biggest Korean-American populations in the U.S. can be found in cities like Los Angeles and New York, the first wave of Korean immigrants were actually farmhands. At the start of the 20th century, the Japanese colonization of Korea had led to widespread oppression and poverty there. At the same time, the U.S. was looking for cheap Asian labor to develop its newest territory, Hawaii, especially due to the fact that Japanese workers there had begun to strike for better wages.\n\nSo the U.S. set up a system of indentured servitude, in which they lured Korean workers to Hawaii with promises of \u201cgold dollars blossoming on every bush\u201d\u2014according to Erika Lee\u2019s The Making of Asian America: A History\u2014and then had them work brutally long days on Hawaii\u2019s sugarcane fields to pay off the price of their voyage. Korean workers were paid less than Japanese laborers and complained of being treated \u201clike draft animals.\u201d They were also prevented from seeking better opportunities on the mainland when an executive order targeted at curbing Japanese migration from Hawaii was also applied to Koreans in 1907.\n\n\u201cThey worked under an extremely highly regimented system of labor with a great deal of surveillance and oversight, and lived in poor housing conditions,\u201d Kim says. \u201cThey were largely held outside of any kind of legal or political safeguards.\u201d\n\nAs living conditions in Korea under Japanese rule continued to deteriorate\u2014and as the original contracts of Korean workers in Hawaii ran out\u2014many Koreans found ways to move to California. There, they once again became farmhands, working alongside Mexicans, African-Americans and other Asian immigrants and helping to turn California agriculture into a multimillion-dollar business. Korean communities with working populations popped up in towns like Reedley, Sacramento and Delano. Dong-hoe, or village councils, were organized on plantations, and Korean churches became central to community life.\n\nBut anti-Asian sentiment was high in California, with the Japanese and Korean Exclusion League gaining clout and political power. Koreans faced harassment and violence and were refused service in restaurants, public recreation facilities, barbershops and renting houses. They were barred from becoming naturalized citizens\u2014and many states passed Alien Land Laws, making it impossible for Koreans to buy their own farmland and control the means of production.\n\nIn the coming decades, the number of Korean and Asian immigrants would stagnate. (During this time, however, Japanese Americans would come to dominate the chick sexing industry, a practice depicted extensively in Minari.) In 1965, President Johnson passed the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, partially in response to the Civil Rights Movement. Over the next 20 years, Koreans would flood into the United States by the thousands, peaking in 1987, when 35,849 arrived.\n\nKim notes that the U.S.\u2019s involvement in the Korean War played a pivotal role in causing this swell in immigration: \u201cIt was direct military intervention that produced these dislocations, and which shaped the South Korean regime of authoritarian military dictatorships. These all provided conditions for people seeking to migrate from South Korea,\u201d he says. The vast majority of Korean-Americans living in the U.S. today now consist of post-1965 immigrants and their children.\n\n\u2018Memories of the Struggle\u2019\n\nMany post-1965 immigrants settled on the coasts, forming Korean-American communities in Los Angeles and Manhattan, where they ran liquor stores or green grocers. (In these positions, they often faced torrents of racist abuse or even boycotts.) But many others harbored rural dreams inspired by those they had in their homeland. In 1971, Yong Chin Chong arrived in California to attend Woodbury University on a student visa; he brought his wife Sun Ok Chong a year later. After graduating, Yong Chin borrowed money from friends to open a liquor mart in Los Angeles.\n\nBut after being robbed several times in his store, he decided to instead put his high school agriculture studies to work and move his family, including newborn baby Joseph, to Ontario, Calif., where he bought a 2\u00bd-acre plot. Much like Jacob in Minari, Yong Chin hoped to grow Korean vegetables and sell them to the rapidly expanding Korean population in Los Angeles. \u201cI figured that was a path to wealth,\u201d he says in Korean, with his son Joseph translating.\n\nThe first few years were rough. Like Minari\u2019s Jacob, Yong Chin agonized over water access; eventually was able to tap into a stream 300 feet below ground. Without any money for additional workers, the couple worked the desolate fields all day, likening themselves to Adam and Eve.\n\nYong Chin\u2019s wife, Sun, experienced acute loneliness. \u201cThere was just land and a house. It was very overwhelming and I didn\u2019t know where to start,\u201d Sun says, also speaking in Korean. \u201cThere were many days and nights where I would just be bunching crops and tying them or pulling weeds, and crying to myself.\u201d\n\nThe Chungs grew Korean radishes, cabbages for kimchi, zucchini and scallions. They also grew minari, a flavorful green, which made watching the movie especially exciting. \u201cIn order to make really good kimchi, you need the cabbage and radish, but you also have to mix in some minari,\u201d Yong Chin explains. \u201cIt was kind of essential.\u201d\n\nWhen Yong Chin and Sun watched the film, Yong Chin said it was \u201cmy own story I was seeing.\u201d Joseph says Sun cried a lot, and was particularly jolted by the scene in which Jacob\u2019s wife Monica (Han Ye-ri) opens up a bag full of goodies brought back from Korea. \u201cThey both reflected on it a lot and talked for hours after the movie about how it reminded them of that time,\u201d Joseph says. \u201cIt brought back a lot of memories of the struggle and the survival and all of that.\u201d\n\nJoseph himself identified deeply with the character David (Alan S. Kim), a young boy who is initially ostracized by the white children around him while also being wary of the seeming strangeness of his Korean grandmother. \u201cI always thought she was raiding our refrigerator,\u201d Joseph says of his own grandmother\u2019s visits. \u201cI was somewhat embarrassed: \u2018Why is this woman here? Why is she so different?\u2019 But over time, we realized she really cared for us and our entire family in her own way tried to show us that.\u201d\n\nJoseph Chong in his family's greenhouse in California in 1989. Joseph Chong\n\n\u201cIt keeps her young\u201d\n\nThe same year that the Chongs arrived in California, so did David Paeng and his family. Paeng, now a farmer, was 4 when he touched down with his parents, who hoped for \u201ca better life,\u201d as he puts it. In Pasadena, Paeng\u2019s father took up odd jobs, including serving as a security guard, before starting a business manufacturing furniture parts.\n\nLike Minari\u2019s David and Joseph Chong, Paeng spent his childhood as the only Asian face in some play groups, and he initially struggled to learn the language and connect with his peers. \u201cMy mother would tell us a story of when I was outside playing with kids, and I don\u2019t know if they were bullying me or harassing me,\u201d he remembers. \u201cShe said, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you stand up for yourself?\u2019 I told her, \u2018I can\u2019t speak the language. What am I supposed to do?\u2019\u201d\n\nWatching Minari, Paeng says it \u201cresonated 100%.\u201d He laughed\u2014and winced\u2014at the scene in which Jacob orders David to bring him a stick to hit him with, only for the son to present him with a twig: \u201cI\u2019ve done exactly that same thing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seems like that was a common form of punishment in Korea, because I would get switched on the calf a lot.\u201d\n\nAnd while Paeng worked in dental equipment sales for many years, he recently bought a farm with his mother Ran Hee Paeng, who believed that the opportunity to buy it had arisen from divine influences. David, like Minari\u2019s Monica, initially wanted nothing to do with the farm, but got reluctantly cajoled into the plan: \u201cIt was a complete leap of faith,\u201d he says.\n\nThe scene at David Paeng's Serenity Farm in Lucerne Valley, Calif., where he grows jujubes. David Paeng\n\nPaeng now grows jujubes, a Chinese date which is sold in Asian markets and used in Chinese tea and medicine. And he\u2019s not the only one: he says there\u2019s a whole community of older Korean-American farmers growing jujubes and other Asian crops in the High Desert in Southern California. \u201cThey want to get out of the city and live a quiet life: great air, nice weather, cheap land,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can invest in a property and plant trees.\u201d\n\nAnd while Paeng tends to his 1,400 jujube trees, his mother Ran Hee cares for a greenhouse on the property, in which she grows Asian vegetables including perilla leaves, eggplants, zucchinis and Napa cabbage, with which she makes her own kimchi. \u201cShe\u2019s like 4\u201810\u201d, 80 pounds\u2014but she\u2019ll push wheelbarrows and do everything,\u201d Paeng says. \u201cIt really keeps her young.\u201d\n\nRan Hee Paeng with a watermelon she grew in Lucerne Valley, Calif. David Paeng\n\nBridging generational gaps\n\nSome 1,700 miles away, on a parcel of land called Peace Village in Robertsville, Mo., a group of Korean women lives together, growing doraji (Bellflower root), gaji (eggplant), cabbages for kimchi and hot peppers. They have been brought there by Pastor Minji Stark, a Korean immigrant who founded the community as a refuge for abandoned Korean women, many of whom married U.S. soldiers who were stationed in Korea before their relationships went awry.\n\n\u201cA lot of Korean women came here 40 years ago when there were not many Koreans around. They had very bad homesickness. Everything was different: the language, the culture,\u201d Stark says. \u201cThere were a lot of sad stories.\u201d\n\nStark herself arrived in 1979 after getting married to a member of the U.S. Air Force who was stationed in Korea; she is one of tens of thousands of women who married American G.I.s following the start of U.S. occupation in Korea in 1945. According to Professor Katharine Moon, who wrote Sex Among Allies: Military Prostitution in U.S.-Korea Relations, possibly 80% of those marriages ended in divorce.\n\nStark says that eight people now live at Peace Village, and that their harvesting of Korean vegetables helps connect them to their homeland. \u201cWhen we were very little, before we were married, we remember what our mamas make,\u201d Stark says. \u201cAt Peace Village, we try to make that kind. People come and they really enjoy it.\u201d\n\nStark loved the movie. She said it brought back many memories of her mother, who, like Minari\u2019s Soonja (Yuh-jung Youn), came to live with her daughter to take care of her grandchildren. She remembered her mother and children trying to bridge cultural gaps in those days: her two-year-old daughter and grandmother teaching each other how to count in each other\u2019s language by pointing at their fingers; her son trying to explain to his grandmother the concept of pancakes.\n\nCoincidentally, Stark said her mother, like Minari\u2019s Soonja, accidentally set a huge fire where they lived while trying to help out around the yard. \u201cShe tried to burn the leaves\u2014it was really windy, so it went further, further, further. When I got home, there were four fire department trucks,\u201d Stark remembers. \u201cMy mother almost had a heart attack, she was so scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are a part of this American landscape\u201d\n\nWhile Minji Stark and David and Ran Hee Paeng continue to seed their plots, so do thousands of other Korean-American and Asian-American farmers across the U.S. There are clusters of Hmong-American farmers in Wisconsin; Laotian-American and Punjabi-American farmers in California\u2019s Central Valley; Vietnamese-American farmers near New Orleans. Many of them are connected by the Asian American Farmers Alliance, which aims to share education and fight for policy change.\n\nEarlier this year, Minari\u2019s studio A24 reached out to Mai Nguyen, who founded the alliance, about organizing an advance screening for her group. When she announced the screening, excitement was so high that the allotted 200 virtual tickets were all claimed within 48 hours. In the end, A24 admitted 300 people into the screening, and Nguyen says her phone exploded afterward with excited responses. \u201cIf you scroll through my text messages, it\u2019s just a bunch of all-caps \u2018WOWs\u2019 and crying emojis,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody was just stunned by how poignant and beautiful this film was.\u201d\n\nNguyen says that in the wake of the screening, a staff member of the United States Department of Agriculture reached out to her \u201cto better understand Asian American farmer needs.\u201d She says the film is especially powerful in a year in which anti-Asian violence has soared. Stigma against Asian farmers is far from ancient history: just five years ago, for example, the Tea Party Patriots ran a campaign ad supporting now-Senator Josh Hawley in which a menacing Chinese businessman buys up Missouri farmland. The title of the ad on YouTube is \u201cStop Helping the Chinese Buy Our Farms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are still considered foreigners,\u201d Nguyen says. \u201cBut we are a part of this American landscape and we have been: we have become enmeshed in and helped build this society. I think it\u2019s really important for people to see us.\u201d\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Law enforcement claimed that they faced a rain of gunfire as they approached the apartment where Hampton, Clark and several other Black Panther Party members were staying. But a subsequent investigation concluded that the police had fired roughly 100 times, and that nearly all of the shells and bullets recovered in the shooting\u2019s aftermath had come from police weapons. Hampton was 21 years old when he died, shot in his sleep.\n\nThere was evidence, too, that the FBI had been tracking Hampton ruthlessly, and that\u2019s the angle King explores here. In Judas and the Black Messiah, Daniel Kaluuya plays Hampton, the charismatic chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party; LaKeith Stanfield is William O\u2019Neal, a party member and the head of Hampton\u2019s security detail\u2014as well as an FBI informant. Judas and the Black Messiah is a somewhat fictionalized version of fact, the story of two men who were supposedly devoted to the same cause\u2014one that arose in response to the country\u2019s entrenched racism, and whose urgency was intensified by the despair that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. But it\u2019s also a story about one man\u2019s betrayal of another, a breach of loyalty that would destroy the lives of both men, roughly 20 years apart. The story of their dual fates has a Shakespearean ring to it, and King leans hard into that sonorous cadence. If the movie leaves you with justified rage at what happened to Hampton, it also teases out complex feelings about what can happen to a man when he sells his soul for illusory riches. Corpses represent only one kind of death; the death of ideals can be just as sorrowful.\n\nBill O'Neal (LaKeith Stanfield) and Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) strike a deal \u00a9 2021 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. All Rights Reserved\n\nWhen we first meet him, Stanfield\u2019s O\u2019Neal is a wily car thief whose MO involves disguising himself as an FBI agent so he can drive off with the goods. The idea sounds preposterous, but it actually works\u2014until it doesn\u2019t. O\u2019Neal gets caught, and the real FBI agent who interrogates him, Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons), is so impressed by his gonzo ingenuity that he offers him a deal: instead of going to jail, O\u2019Neal can work through his sentence by infiltrating the Chicago Black Panther Party. O\u2019Neal finds himself drawn to the party\u2019s goals and ideals, even as he\u2019s dazzled by the prospect of living the high life\u2014represented by trappings like good cigars and fine scotch\u2014that Mitchell dangles before him.\n\nRead more reviews by Stephanie Zacharek\n\nAs O\u2019Neal burrows deeper into his illicit work, he also draws closer to Hampton, a figure who\u2019s rising in the party: his speeches are eloquent and galvanizing, and he\u2019s easily earned the loyalty of the group\u2019s members. The Panthers, motivated to drastically change a system that had long kept them beaten down, took their role as revolutionaries seriously: they believed in arming themselves, and they were willing to use violence if necessary. King dramatizes some of that violence, without necessarily condoning it or romanticizing it. (He also depicts instances of the police baiting and taunting members of the Panthers and their community, spoiling for a fight.) But if the Panthers generally assumed an intimidating stance, they also administered breakfast programs for kids, and sought to improve education for young people as a means of empowerment. Hampton hardly disavowed violence, but Judas and the Black Messiah puts more emphasis on his desire to improve the lives of the people in his community. He hopes to build a medical center; he brings together a multiracial coalition that includes disenfranchised white people and local gang members who might otherwise be the Panthers\u2019 enemies. And he falls in love with a young woman, Deborah Johnson (Dominique Fishback), who not only sees poetry in him, but also helps lighten his burden of self-seriousness.\n\nDaniel Kaluuya and Dominique Fishback \u00a9 2021 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. All Rights Reserved\n\nKaluuya\u2019s portrayal of Hampton has a capacious magnetism, as if to capture not just the spirit of one man, but also the potential that had already begun to bloom around him, a future he was ready to grow into. This Hampton is ever-thoughtful, given somewhat to brooding, but mostly to action. He\u2019s cautious about his new friend and follower O\u2019Neal, but ends up being won over by him. Because as Stanfield plays him, O\u2019Neal is a natural seducer\u2014smart, seemingly sincere, and just awkward enough to be endearing. In one scene perched expertly between tense and funny, several Panthers who momentarily suspect O\u2019Neal as a traitor challenge him to hot-wire a car, as proof that he actually knows how to do it. He pulls it off, but not without sweating and fumbling, and this is where you see his true vulnerability: he\u2019s eager to pass any test of authenticity the Panthers may throw at him, because he longs to truly be one of them\u2014even as he prepares to send the man he most respects down the river. If Kaluuya is the backbone of Judas and the Black Messiah, Stanfield is its agonized soul. William O\u2019Neal wrote his own tragedy, and Stanfield breathes life into it here, a confused, twisting spirit forever trapped in a hell of its own making.\n\nGet The Brief.

Senators clustered together in apparent confusion and Senators Ron Johnson and Mitt Romney engaged in a heated conversation.\n\nTrump is the first US president to be impeached twice and the first to face trial after leaving office. If convicted, the Senate could then vote to bar him from running for office again.\n\nConviction is seen as unlikely, however, as at least 17 Republicans in the 100-seat chamber would have to join all 50 Democrats to find the former president guilty.\n\nOnly six Republicans voted with Democrats to move forward with the trial, rejecting an argument made by other Republican senators that the constitution does not allow Congress to impeach a president who has already left office.\n\nQuestions about Trump\u2019s role in riot\n\nThe trial has highlighted the extraordinary danger lawmakers faced on January 6, when Trump urged his followers to march to the Capitol and \u201cget wild\u201d in an effort to prevent Congress from certifying his defeat to Democrat Joe Biden in the presidential election. Five people died in the chaos.\n\nSecurity camera footage presented at the trial showed rioters came perilously close to lawmakers as they were evacuated from the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nAmong those targeted was Vice President Mike Pence, who had refused Trump\u2019s entreaties to interfere with the proceedings earlier that day.\n\nTrump criticised Pence on Twitter as lacking \u201ccourage\u201d shortly after Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville told Trump that the vice president was being evacuated for his own safety.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers gave conflicting answers on Friday when asked if Trump knew Pence was in danger when he issued his tweet. Several Republican senators said they still had questions about Trump\u2019s role.\n\n\u201cThe issue is what was the president\u2019s intent, right? Only the president could answer. And the president chose not to,\u201d Republican Senator Bill Cassidy told reporters. He said he had not made up his mind on how to vote.\n\nTrump refused to testify in the trial.\n\nMarching orders\n\nHouse Democrats making the case for impeachment have argued that Trump set the stage for violence through repeated \u2013 and baseless \u2013 claims that the election results were fraudulent. They say he summoned the mob to Washington, DC, gave the crowd its marching orders and did nothing to stop the violence as it played out on television.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, at this point, how many minds get changed,\u201d Senator John Thune, the chamber\u2019s number two Republican, told reporters on Friday.\n\nAs many as 10 Republicans could find Trump guilty, according to a Senate aide, which would still be short of the 67 votes needed for conviction. Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who reprimanded Trump after the January 6 attack, will vote to acquit Trump, a source told the news agency Reuters.\n\n\u2018Hatred\u2019 not facts\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s impeachment lawyers accused the Democrats of waging a campaign of \u201chatred\u201d against the former president, a day after they vigorously denied Trump had incited the deadly riot.\n\nAccording to Al Jazeera\u2019s Heidi Zhou-Castro, Trump\u2019s defence team has three prongs to their argument.\n\n\u201cOne being that this trial is unconstitutional because it is trying a former president for the very first time,\u201d Zhou-Castro said, speaking from Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.\n\n\u201cThey also say that the First Amendment protected Trump\u2019s political speech. They showed videos of Democrats using similar language like \u2018fight\u2019 in some of their political talk.\u201d\n\nThe third argument is that Trump\u2019s lawyers say the trial \u201clacked due process\u201d, she continued, which is another reason for it being \u201cunconstitutional\u201d in their point of view.\n\nTrump\u2019s first impeachment trial, which stemmed from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, ended in an acquittal a year ago in what was then a Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nPublic divided\n\nRichard Pacelle, a professor of American politics at the University of Tennessee, told Al Jazeera that the American public is split on impeaching Trump for a second time.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is a pretty political weapon,\u201d he said. \u201cAround 60 percent support conviction and 40 percent don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe said the partisan divide in the US is \u201cvery bad\u201d but suggested that there could be a slight move towards the political centre, with some Republicans in Congress voting with Democrats to convict Trump.\n\n\u201cWith 10 Republicans in the House and maybe six or seven set to cross in the Senate, and with about 140,000 people in the last few days renouncing their membership of the Republican Party, we may be seeing a little bit of a movement back towards the middle,\u201d he said.", "meta_img": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AP_21043714579198.jpg?resize=1200%2C630"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9676669836044312}, "keywords": ["News", "Donald Trump", "United States", "US & Canada"], "summary": "Democrats and Republicans in the US Senate headed off a prolonged impeachment trial for Donald Trump on Saturday with an agreement to enter into evidence details of the former president \u2019s remarks in a call with a top Republican during the deadly Capitol riot.

Instead, he was rebuffed and embarrassed, with Russia expelling three EU diplomats while he was holding talks.\n\nAfter his return, Borrell, addressing the European Parliament earlier this week, said his visit had confirmed his view that Moscow wanted to sever ties with Europe and divide the West. He said the Kremlin sees democracy as an \"existential threat.\"\n\n\"The Russian government is going down a worrisome authoritarian route,\" Borrell said on Monday. \"There seems to be almost no room for the development of democratic alternatives ... they are merciless in stifling any such attempts.\"\n\nIn a recent editorial in the Moscow Times, an English-language daily, political analyst Vladimir Frolov suggested that instead of hurting Putin, the controversy surrounding Navalny actually plays into Russia's hands.\n\n\"Domestically, it reinforces official propaganda about hostile interference from abroad, incursions on Russia's sovereignty and the activity of foreign agents,\" Frolov wrote. \"On the foreign policy front, it frees the Kremlin from having to stage what the West calls 'malicious actions' with the goal of provoking retaliatory anti-Russian actions that would consolidate Russian society around the flag of the ruling regime.\"", "meta_img": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/02/12/gettyimages-1231113425_wide-f001cc2251239d6b2ff50e5d3eb748fe748ba938.jpg?s=1400"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9368137717247009}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Russia Threatens To Cut Ties With EU If Sanctions Are Imposed Over Jailing Of Navalny \n\n Enlarge this image toggle caption Anadolu Agency / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Anadolu Agency / Anadolu Agency via Getty Images \n\n Russia said Friday that it is prepared to cut ties with the European Union if the bloc slaps economic sanctions on the Kremlin in retaliation for the detention of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. \n\n Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was asked in an interview on the Russian YouTube channel Solovyov Live whether Moscow is moving toward severing ties with the EU."}, "category": "World"}, {"id": "ba524801-1d5d-47a8-9ac1-08aeffd7c5da", "source": "npr", "data": {"title": "Village Teacher Wins $1 Million Prize For World's Most 'Exceptional' Educator", "link": "https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/02/12/966835697/village-teacher-wins-1-million-prize-for-worlds-most-exceptional-educator", "description": "Ranjitsinh Disale from India has been honored for finding ways to educate girls whose parents don't want them to come to school.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 09:14:13 -0500", "body": "Village Teacher Wins $1 Million Prize For World's Most 'Exceptional' Educator\n\nYouTube\n\nIn 2010, Indian teacher Ranjitsinh Disale heard that one of his teenage female students was going to marry a man in his 30s.\n\n\"I directly went to the girl's house and told her father, 'You cannot do this,' \" says Disale, 32, who currently teaches third- and fourth-graders at a government school in Paritewadi, a small village in western India.\n\nWhen the father didn't agree, Disale called the police because child marriage is illegal in India. Together they counseled the father. Finally, he called off the wedding.\n\nIt's actions like this that helped earn Disale the title of the world's most \"exceptional teacher.\"\n\nAbout Goats and Soda Goats and Soda is NPR's global health and development blog.

He was one of more than 12,000 teachers from over 140 countries nominated for the prize.\n\nThe organizations praise Disale for going above and beyond his job description. Over the years, he has learned a new language, invented ways to help students learn with technology and even endured attacks \u2014 all to ensure his students, especially girls, can keep learning.\n\n\"[Disale has] transformed the life chances of young girls,\" the Varkey Foundation said in a statement. \"The impact of [his] interventions has been extraordinary: There are now no teenage marriages in the village and 100% attendance by girls at the school.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption The Varkey Foundation The Varkey Foundation\n\nDisale was declared the winner at a virtual ceremony broadcast from London. When British actor and comedian Stephen Fry announced his name, Disale, at home in India, screamed in excitement and hugged his overjoyed parents seated on either side of him. Congratulatory messages poured in from politicians including former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan and even the Dalai Lama.\n\nHis students rejoiced, too.\n\n\"They were dancing in celebration and they kept saying, 'Sir, we are proud of you,' \" says Disale. \"That's the biggest moment for a teacher, I can't express that feeling in words.\"\n\nDisale hadn't always planned to be a teacher. He was studying to be an engineer but dropped out because of bullying by his peers. He enrolled in a teacher training course on his father's suggestion and was posted to Paritewadi in 2009 for his first assignment.\n\n\"Day 1 was shocking,\" says Disale.\n\nHis classroom was overrun by cows and buffaloes. A farmer had turned it into a cattle shed and refused to leave.\n\n\"I had to register a police complaint,\" says Disale. \"[The farmer] would shout at me and throw stones at my bike.\"\n\nEven bigger challenges lay ahead.\n\nMost of Disale's students come from low-income families who depend on farming. Many belong to tribal communities where early marriage is common.\n\n\"They feel that girls are just made for [marrying],\" says Disale.\n\nDisale also says many parents thought school was a waste of money for their kids because they see even educated people struggling to get jobs.\n\n\"They felt the better option is to take the children to the farm [to work] so that they get some experience,\" says Disale.\n\nSo Disale set out to change their mindset. When his students didn't show up to class, Disale says he would go to the fields to talk to their parents. He learned their native language Kannada to gain their trust and translated the curriculum from Marathi, a language some students did not speak, into Kannada.\n\nTo further boost student attendance, around 2010, he introduced technology in the classroom.\n\nHe bought a new laptop with money from his dad and would show movies and play songs for his young students. \"When they went back home, they would start talking about it with their friends who would then get interested in coming to school,\" says Disale.\n\nOnce he had his students' attention, he would play educational videos and songs that covered topics in their curriculum.\n\nBut some parents were still not sending their kids, particularly girls, to school, he says.\n\nSo Disale came up with a way to get the school curriculum to the girls.\n\nHe started making digital versions of his lesson plans. He created PowerPoint presentations, translated educational videos from YouTube and made videos of his classroom lectures. He called parents with female students at home to drop by the school on the weekends so he could transfer the digital files from his laptop to their mobile devices. His elementary school students, many of whom are mobile savvy, could then use their parents' devices to keep up with what Disale was teaching in class \u2014 and Internet connectivity, he says, is good in the village.\n\nThere was one problem. The files were sometimes not supported by the mobile devices or would get corrupted during the transfer. So in 2014, Disale devised a workaround: He would make the videos, links, audio files and homework available to download over the Internet using QR codes, or quick response codes. He would print stickers with the QR codes and distribute them among his students.\n\nThe students were particularly interested in videos of Disale teaching lessons that they had trouble understanding, says Disale. It was used not just by kids at home, but also by kids coming to school, too. If they had a doubt or question about what they learned in class, they could revisit Disale's recorded lectures.\n\n\"It was like a miracle,\" says Disale, adding that the academic performance of his students, especially girls, improved drastically.\n\nFor this reason, he proposed the idea of QR-coded textbooks to the government in Maharashtra, the state where Paritewadi is located. And in 2017, the government announced it would introduce textbooks with QR codes in the entire state. The codes link to supplementary teaching materials, such as explanatory videos, for students who need a bit more help in grasping concepts in the book.\n\nAs for Disale, the QR codes in the textbooks proved to be a blessing when schools closed during the coronavirus lockdown. His students were able to continue doing their work from home on mobile phones and switch to virtual learning easily.\n\n\"The lockdown has taught us that we cannot rely on traditional ways of teaching,\" says Disale. \"Technology should be an integral part of teaching.\"\n\nWhat differentiates Disale from other teachers is that he did not depend on the system but paved his own way to fulfill his role as a teacher, says Francis Joseph, co-founder of an education nonprofit called School Leaders Network. He has known Disale for several years.\n\nGovernment schoolteachers in India often lack motivation, says Joseph, because they get paid whether students learn or not. No one questions them. Teacher truancy is also common. According to a 2016 World Bank report, nearly 24% of teachers in some 1,300 Indian villages surveyed were absent during unannounced visits.\n\n\"You just need some champions [like Disale] to lead a revolution in increasing the motivation and interest among other teachers,\" says Joseph.\n\nDisale says he's now working on a project to promote world peace by connecting tens of thousands of students from conflict zones around the world. The Let's Cross the Borders project is a six-week program in which students are matched with a \"peace buddy\" from another country via Skype. Students interact with their buddies, prepare presentations and listen to guest speakers together to understand their similarities.\n\nWhen he was named the winner, Disale announced that he would share half of his $1 million prize with the other nine finalists who come from different parts of the world including Italy, Vietnam, Brazil and Nigeria. He says he will use his share of the prize to build a network of like-minded teachers in India who are passionate about innovation in learning.\n\n\"I want to see many Ranjitsinh Disales from India,\" he says.", "meta_img": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/02/11/teacher_prize_wide-32e94528290abbe75d09473ef70673b0cb2b340a.jpg?s=1400"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9995832443237305}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Village Teacher Wins $ 1 Million Prize For World 's Most ' Exceptional ' Educator \n\n YouTube \n\n In 2010 , Indian teacher Ranjitsinh Disale heard that one of his teenage female students was going to marry a man in his 30s.

He was owed $17.5 million in 2021, but his salary was not guaranteed. He is now free to sign with another team.\n\nLeague sources told ESPN's Ed Werder that approximately a dozen teams initially had shown interest in Watt since his release, including the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, Buffalo Bills and Tennessee Titans. Sources said Watt's priority in determining his next team will be his belief that he can play in a Super Bowl with that team based on its supporting cast; he has never reached a conference championship game.\n\nWatt's brothers, T.J. and Derek, both play for the Steelers. T.J. took to Twitter after J.J. Watt announced his release Friday, showing he wants his brother to join them in Pittsburgh.\n\nJ.J. Watt is coming off just his second 16-game season since 2015, as he has dealt with several season-ending injuries since then.\n\n\"Change is never easy, especially when it involves the ones you love. J.J.'s impact on not only our organization, but the entire Houston community, is unlike any player in our franchise's history,\" Texans chair and CEO Cal McNair said in a prepared statement. \"I told J.J. earlier this week that we will forever consider him a Texan. We take solace in knowing that this is not a goodbye but a 'see you soon.' For now, we will build upon the foundation that J.J. created here and forge ahead with our unwavering mission to bring a championship to our city, create memorable experiences for our fans and do great things for Houston.\"\n\nIn 2020, Watt ranked 15th out of 119 qualified pass-rushers in pass rush win rate, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. He finished the season with five sacks, two forced fumbles and an interception that he returned for a touchdown.\n\nWatt is by far the most productive pass-rusher in Texans history with 101 career sacks. There have been only two players in team history with more than 30 career sacks (Whitney Mercilus with 54 and Mario Williams with 53) since the franchise's first season in 2002.\n\n\"He's one of the best defensive players in history,\" McNair told ESPN's Adam Schefter. \"It's hard to put in a sentence or two because he has meant so much to the team and city. His legacy will be with us for years. It's bye for now, but not bye for good. My kids grew up with him. He's played with them on the sidelines. One of my kids shares a birthday with him. Mom is a big fan of his. He's just meant so much to all of us. This is doing right by him, and this gives him time to pick his next stop.\"\n\nDuring the season, Watt made it clear he was not interested in playing for a team going through a \"rebuild.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's any secret that I don't have 10 years left in this league,\" Watt said in November. \"I personally believe that I do have a few more great ones left in me. But you also can't ... I'm not looking to rebuild. I'm looking to go after a championship, and that's what I want to do.\"\n\nWhen asked at the end of the season whether he felt the 2021 Texans would be in rebuilding mode, Watt said there are \"so many unknown factors to that situation right now that you can't definitively say that.\"\n\n\"Change is going to happen. It's part of the NFL,\" McNair told Schefter. \"It's inevitable but not always easy. It's bittersweet. That's my word of today for J.J. We have gratitude for J.J. Giving him plenty of time to pick his next destination is the right move.\"\n\nWhile one player is leaving, another remains locked in a stalemate with the team, as Deshaun Watson has requested a trade despite the Texans reiterating they have no intention of dealing the star quarterback.\n\n\"There is a lot of misinformation out there,\" McNair told Schefter. \"I'll leave it at that. Today we want on focus on J.J. Deshaun is our QB, he is a Texan, and we expect him to remain a Texan, and we'll leave it at that.\"\n\nWatt's departure comes in an offseason in which the Texans have hired coach David Culley and general manager Nick Caserio to replace Bill O'Brien, who held both jobs and was fired after the team opened the season 0-4.\n\nThe day after Watt's release, he tweeted that he woke up to \"a flood of $99 donations\" to his foundation. There were donations from Houston and cities all over the country, \"presumably attempts at bribes, judging by the messages attached with some.\"\n\n\"Kids all over the country will benefit from your generosity,\" Watt tweeted.", "meta_img": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F0212%2Fr813986_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9928510189056396}, "keywords": ["NFL", "Houston Texans", "J.J.

He threw approximately 40 passes -- mostly from under center -- to receivers Cornell Powell, Charone Peake, Caleb Scott and Chris Finke at Clemson's indoor practice facility.\n\nLawrence said he's expecting to start throwing six to eight weeks after the surgery and be fully cleared after four to five months.\n\nOn Friday, Lawrence threw a variety of passes, which included some rollouts, and ended with a 65-yard throw on a broken play in which he scrambled before launching the ball. That throw drew praise from the ESPN on-air crew as well as on social media. But ESPN NFL draft analyst Todd McShay, who was at the workout, was more impressed with Lawrence's work in the red zone.\n\n\"Quickly getting the ball out and throwing the ball high where the defender can't go get it,\" McShay said on the broadcast. \"I saw that consistently inside the red zone today, just the ability to throw the ball high in that specific spot, the ball placement.\n\n\"Yes, the deep throws were great and the vertical throws is what everyone loves ... But inside the red zone you can learn a little bit about a quarterback in terms of how quick he gets it out and where he places that ball.\"\n\nThirty-one people from 17 NFL teams were scheduled to attend the workout, including three from the Jacksonville Jaguars: head coach Urban Meyer, offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell and passing game coordinator Brian Schottenheimer. The Jaguars own the top pick in the April 29 draft and Meyer spent almost the entire workout standing alongside Clemson coach Dabo Swinney several yards from Lawrence.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. I saw him,\" Lawrence said with a smile. \"I saw a lot of the guys coming through, but yeah, I saw him. Just waved at him real quick. Can't really communicate out there. But yeah, it's been cool to see all the teams come out. It's definitely a cool thing to experience. I'm glad I got to still do it.\"\n\nLawrence -- who measured in at 6-foot-5 5/8 and 213 pounds with 10-inch hands, 34\u00bd-inch arms, and a 78\u00bc-inch wingspan -- said he's most looking forward to learning a new offensive system as well as adjusting to life in the NFL. He said he enjoys the mental challenge of football, which is something every coach wants to hear.\n\n\"I think, mentally, obviously, the game's a little bit different at the NFL level and what's on your plate,\" Lawrence said. \"So just taking this time, especially after surgery, to really prepare mentally while I can't physically and then once I can physically really I'm going to just be grinding and getting ready. Just really excited for that challenge.\n\n\"I love learning. That's one of my favorite parts about the game. It's such a fun thing to learn a new system and kind of piece everything together. It's a lot of fun so I'm excited to do that, but I think that's the biggest thing is just mentally, defensive recognition, playbook, all that stuff.\"", "meta_img": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2020%2F1215%2Fr790670_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9891247153282166}, "keywords": ["news", "NFL", "College Football", "Jacksonville Jaguars", "Clemson Tigers"], "summary": "Lawrence moved up his pro day because he is scheduled to undergo surgery to repair damage to the labrum in his left ( non - throwing ) shoulder and wanted to be completely cleared before training camps open in July.

The former Raven was vocal about how past defenses didn't want to tackle Henry and vowed that it would be different when the Titans played the Ravens in the divisional playoff round. The veteran cornerback had a one-on-one opportunity to tackle Henry, but it ended in a disaster. Henry stiff-armed Thomas twice on the same play, almost sending him in a complete circle to cap off a 27-yard run.\n\nWhat he said: \"Good to see you.

Unfortunately, Myres fell victim to Henry's stiff-arm in Week 15 last season. The Detroit Lions defensive back went up to tackle Henry, but the running back planted him right to the ground.\n\nWhat he said: \"I told him yesterday on the bench when he came off, I told him he deserved that,\" Lions defensive coordinator Cory Undlin said of the stiff-arm the day after the game. \"I was telling him you come up with the wrong leverage on that guy and that ball shows up on the edge, you end up having to run sideways with this guy, you're going to take a stiff-arm in the temple.

Henry towers over Mark Ingram II\n\nDate: Jan. 11, 2016\n\nWhy it went viral: Henry was accompanied by former Alabama running back Mark Ingram II for the coin toss at midfield before the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship between the Crimson Tide and Clemson. A camera caught Henry and Ingram standing together and there was quite a contrast in size. At 6-foot-3, 247 pounds, Henry skied over Ingram, who checked in at 5-foot-9, 215 pounds. The fact that Henry had his equipment on magnified the size difference even more. The facial expression that Ingram made as he looked over at Henry was priceless. The internet had a field day!\n\nWhat he said: \"[Henry] is 6-4 with cleats on and a helmet, and I'm 5-10,\" Ingram said via CBS Sports Network's Super Bowl coverage. \"Obviously, you put him closer to the camera. You put me further from the camera. The coin toss is in there, so I'm looking in there, looks like I'm looking at him sideways. Man, the whole thing was just a setup.

He exploded for 238 yards, including a 99-yard touchdown scamper that tied him with Tony Dorsett for the NFL's longest touchdown run ever. Henry dished out four stiff-arms and almost stiff-armed his own teammate Corey Davis, who was blocking down the field for him. The run ignited a stretch in which Henry gained 585 yards in the final four games to go over the 1,000-yard rushing plateau for the first time in his career.\n\nWhat he said: \"We were talking about where we were on the field and how far we had to go,\" Henry said. \"Everybody was like, 'Let's take it 99 yards!' Marcus [Mariota] came in and made a playcall, but he audibled it and called a run.

That's exactly what Henry did against Buffalo Bills cornerback Josh Norman in Week 5 this season. Norman made a critical mistake by trying to tackle Henry up top, setting himself up for a vicious stiff-arm that sent him flying. The play was negated by offsetting penalties that caused the down to be played over, but the stiff-arm on Norman became an instant hit on social media.\n\nWhat he said: \"You took social distancing way too far. 'Get your punk ass out of here.' You threw Josh Norman's ass under the damn Gatorade,\" comedian Steve Harvey said on the NFL Honors show.\n\nSocial stats: 1M views, 11.2K likes", "meta_img": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F0212%2Fnfl_derrick%2Dhenry%2Dviral%2Dmoments_16x9.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9991617798805237}, "keywords": ["NFL", "Tennessee Titans", "Derrick Henry", "daily"], "summary": "NASHVILLE , Tenn. -- Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry was named the 2020 NFL offensive MVP. \n\n Henry became the eighth player in NFL history to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "015201cf-ab31-40f0-a741-a5b1301a1069", "source": "espn", "data": {"title": "Former Lions Calvin Johnson, Rob Sims believe in the science, potential of cannabis industry", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30862032/former-lions-calvin-johnson-rob-sims-believe-science-potential-cannabis-industry", "description": "The teammates-turned-business partners believe the research their company is doing can unlock healing potential and undo the stigma of cannabis.", "published": "Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:17:53 EST", "body": "WEBBERVILLE, Mich. -- Calvin Johnson walks into the brightly lit, orange-hued Flower Room 1 and begins to get excited. In front of him are 180 marijuana plants, all lined up in rows of three or four, broken down in identical, segmented trays for optimal growth.\n\nClad in a mask, black scrubs and Crocs, the retired Detroit Lions receiver walks up and down the aisles, inspecting each plant, looking at the varied flowers. Johnson, who was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this past weekend, looks a little different than he did as an NFL player. He's thinner with strands of gray in the front of his grown-out hair.\n\nStanding alongside his current business partner, former offensive guard Rob Sims, Johnson examines the plants in one of six flower rooms, pleased with the progress.\n\n\"Get better every run,\" Johnson said, particularly happy with the density in each of the flowers he's observing. \"Nice little jungle in there.\"\n\n\"Keeps getting better,\" Sims replied.\n\nThis had been the hope all along, what they had been working for the past two years after deciding to enter the cannabis industry. So far, 15 states plus Washington, D.C., have fully legalized cannabis, according to ballotpedia.org, while many others have either approved its medicinal use or decriminalized usage of the drug.\n\nJohnson, left, and former Lions guard Rob Sims, right, have teamed up again -- this time in the cannabis industry, producing their own marijuana. They have opened two dispensaries in Michigan. Rob Sims\n\nJohnson and Sims went from a life in football, in which so much was dictated and provided, to the world of a startup, building everything from scratch. They created Primitiv, a cannabis company they hope will improve quality of life for those in pain, eliminate some of the negative connotations around marijuana and, of course, make money in their second career.\n\n\"Our vision is we're trying to change the stigma around cannabis,\" Sims said. \"We don't call it bud. We call it medicine.\"\n\nFIVE TO SIX DAYS a week, Sims and Johnson drive from their suburban Detroit homes to Primitiv's cultivation facility in Webberville, Michigan, to manage their 15-person team, inspect their product and make sure their business is flowing toward the level of production they have anticipated.\n\nCombined, they've made more than $130 million in their NFL careers. They don't have to work. They want to work. This has become their profession, investing \"easily\" more than $1 million in building their company.\n\n\"This is our life's work at this point,\" Sims said. \"We've put a lot into this.\"\n\nJohnson and Sims didn't plan to start here. Johnson first tried marijuana recreationally in college at Georgia Tech. By the middle of his NFL career, he figured out the medicinal benefits it provided.\n\nBy the end of his career, Johnson used cannabis after every game and sometimes during the week to help lessen the \"daily drag to get up out of bed in the morning, just really inflammation at the end of the day.\" It became part of his weekly regimen to get himself back to being able to play the following Sunday.\n\nIn the locker room during their nine NFL seasons, Johnson and Sims, who were never disciplined for marijuana usage while in the league, saw the combined potential of what cannabis could do for pain management. They believe it's a safer alternative to painkillers.\n\n\"There are a lot of untold stories about this, and to be quite frank, a player is going to have to deal with pain either way it goes. There's a safer way,\" Sims said. \"There's an alternative that can help guys and that is safe, you know what I mean? It's not something that guys can get all messed up on and it's a lot to lose.\n\n\"What do you do when you're done playing the game and you need painkillers and you can't get them as easy as you could when you played? What do you do? What's the answer for that?\"\n\nThe NFL loosened its marijuana policies last season, eliminating suspensions, shortening the testing period to two weeks in training camp and upping the amount of THC necessary for a positive test. Sims called this a victory for players, who now have another way to handle their pain.\n\nJohnson inspects the crops at his and Sims' marijuana grow facility in Webberville, Michigan. Michael Rothstein\n\nPain doesn't stop when football careers end. In retirement, Johnson almost quit \"Dancing With the Stars\" in 2016 because of the agony and swelling in his ankles. In California, where medical marijuana was already legal, one of Johnson's friends from Georgia Tech gave him a small brown jar with a golden cap, a topical.\n\n\"I was using it every day for the dance show,\" Johnson said. \"I still have just a little bit left at home, but I literally got through that dance show because of that. Literally.\"\n\nJohnson, who said topicals are his favorite, was sold. He uses it on his fingers -- beaten up and twisted from years of football -- and rubs his joints with it before rounds of golf.\n\nWHILE THEY WERE INTRIGUED by getting into the industry, cannabis was not recreationally legal in Michigan until 2018. Both were focused on other ventures since Sims retired after the 2014 season and Johnson after 2015.\n\nThey invested in real estate. Johnson dabbled in franchising the pretzel store Auntie Anne's and mentored receivers preparing for the NFL draft -- including future Pro Bowler and Tampa Bay Buccaneer Chris Godwin. Johnson ran his youth camp, assisted with his foundation and occasionally showed up at practices of various teams to help impart knowledge on future generations.\n\nThrough their company, Locker Room Consulting, Johnson and Sims came up with plans to help athletes transition out of college and professional sports into the real world by helping them figure out what interests them. When cannabis was legalized in Michigan, Sims and Johnson wanted to become involved there, too.\n\n\"I have long been silent in other partnerships in other states, so it's just like, I want to get involved on the grassroots level from the ground up, you know?\" Johnson said. \"I really want to be involved in this thing. I believe in it. I know it because I used it. It helps me with inflammation. It helps me with pain. So I'm like, 'OK, let's really get down to the science of this.'\"\n\nJohnson and Sims did more than lend their names. They became entrepreneurs, running every aspect of the up-and-down life of a startup, including initial licensing rejection in December 2018 due to an unpaid speeding ticket in Georgia for Johnson and real estate issues for Sims.\n\nThose problems resolved, they reapplied, received their license in February 2019 and began their company. The two talk multiple times daily and work multiple days per week in either their facility in Webberville or at their soon-to-be-open first dispensary in Niles, Michigan.\n\nCannabis is a growing industry. In 2019, a Pew Research Center study showed two-thirds of Americans believe marijuana should be legalized. Johnson and Sims entering the space is another boon for a cannabis industry already on the rise. Between medical and recreational sales, the industry is projected to have brought in $18.2 billion in 2020 and grow to $23.9 billion by 2021, according to numbers provided by Headset.io, which tracks the cannabis industry.\n\nWhen they started in the space, Sims and Johnson said their families had questions -- in part because of the connotations they are trying to eliminate.\n\n\"Shoot, it's a big stigma,\" Johnson said. \"Mom, Mrs. Johnson, didn't like it. I can't say my dad was a big fan of it. But now, they haven't been able to see it, but they've been able to see the time, just from what I've shown them and what Brittney [Johnson's wife] talks to them about it. I don't even talk about it that much, but I do like to show them.\n\n\"I'd rather show them in person. I get them on FaceTime and I walk them through the facility, but they really see the time that goes into it and I'm able to show them the things that we're doing and they were like, 'OK, this isn't a hobby. This is real. This is a business.'\"\n\nSims is excited about the potential that the cannabis industry offers his and Johnson's company and society in general. Michael Rothstein\n\nJohnson says this in one of the many rooms of their nondescript, two-story building in a Webberville office park 70 miles northwest of Detroit. On this October day, their address is scrawled in black writing on a big, white, poster board sign. The faded stenciling of ML Chartier, the building's former tenants who moved next door, is visible. Johnson and Sims have since improved their signage, one of many small things in building a company from the ground up.\n\nThey are here because this is the \"green zone,\" an area denoted by the state of Michigan for cannabis growth. This building, where every inch of space is being used, is the first phase of what they had been working on for two years.\n\nAnd having their names attached -- not as just spokesmen, but entrepreneurs in the space -- can help the industry.\n\n\"Athletes like those guys getting in and being the face of a cannabis company, being a face of the cannabis movement is very helpful,\" said Andrew DeAngelo, a consultant for the global cannabis industry and the co-founder of Harborside, one of the oldest dispensaries in California. \"Because it gives another archetype in pop culture that's cannabis-positive. That's very helpful to the story of cannabis, the brand of cannabis as a plant, as a healing agent in society.\n\n\"I'm thrilled that folks like that are coming in.\"\n\nAs the business has grown from concept to construction and then production, Sims and Johnson began implementing another plan: making sure the cannabis they harvested would eventually be ready for consumption.\n\nDR. WILFRED NGWA STUDIED all over the world, and for the past 10 years, he's been working at Harvard, researching ways to increase quality treatment for cancer patients.\n\nIn 2019, he was one of the organizers at the Global Health Catalyst summit at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. One of the goals of the summit is to introduce people from different areas and businesses to see if they can work together on shared visions addressing disparities for the future of global health. One of Ngwa's invitees was Dr. Tommy Shavers, the co-founder of NESTRE Health and Performance, a neuro-strength company working with neuroplasticity that had begun a partnership with Johnson and Sims. One of the people Shavers brought to the conference was Johnson.\n\nJohnson spoke about cannabis, how it minimized his pain, and their plans for the industry. He explained the concerns about chronic traumatic encephalopathy, brain degeneration likely caused by repeated head trauma and more commonly known as CTE, in football players. Johnson said he doesn't think about whether he has it; Sims does think about it. They both have wondered how cannabis might provide relief. By the end of the summit, Johnson and Sims began speaking with Ngwa about potentially collaborating on finding better treatment for pain and CTE.\n\n\"That kind of fit,\" Sims said. \"We had an opportunity in cannabis and at the same time, in parallel, realized that, hey, some of these things that are ailing us as former players are things that we are able to explore and find treatments for. I would say they happened in parallel.\"\n\nNgwa works with nanodrones, which can help target medicine to patients more precisely in their bodies instead of it having an overall effect. Ngwa's hope is the technology can even cross the blood-brain barrier -- a layer in the head that keeps out toxins that could cause infection -- to deliver medicine more effectively.\n\nIt would eliminate the side effect of the general high from cannabis -- not everyone likes that, Ngwa said -- and can focus the medicine to where it's most needed.\n\n\"Tommy, he shared that with Calvin and Rob, they started this cannabis company as a way you could deliver some of these cannabinoids,\" Ngwa said. \"One, to direct pain, and two, we have preliminary research that kind of shows, if you target these drugs across the blood-brain barrier in your head, they can inhibit the degeneration of when you have a concussion and slow that down.\"\n\nThe plan, once Johnson and Sims donated money to the International Phytomedicines and Medical Cannabis Institute, a multi-institutional collaboration located at Harvard, was to provide concrete evidence this could work.\n\nDonating the funds allows Johnson and Sims to have their cannabis tested by Ngwa and his team for quality assurance. It will develop a profile of each strain and product to get a gauge on its efficacy, as well as breakdowns of THC or CBD.\n\nAfter quality assurance, Ngwa hopes to use their product in a multi-institutional research agreement still being finalized for clinical trial use. This is not exclusive to Sims and Johnson's company, but the hope is to work with them to find potential real ways to use cannabis to help with pain management and CTE.\n\nNgwa said putting the cannabis through that type of study can help create \"a reference or uniform standard for medical cannabis products.\"\n\n\"We have to do studies that show that their formulation of cannabis really can do the things that we want to see in terms of chemical benefit,\" Ngwa said. \"So if someone is using it to address pain, then it actually does that.\n\n\"So by doing studies in animals and then doing clinical trials to show that it can eliminate pain, so, yeah, we want to use, they are providing cannabis from the company.\"\n\nThe plan initially was to start last year. The COVID-19 pandemic slowed things. Now, Sims and Johnson are planning to send their first samples to Ngwa within the next few months for testing once the paperwork is finalized.\n\nSims said they would send samples from their rarer flower strains and, once the other ideas are finalized, fully packaged versions of the nasal sprays, nebulizers and other products. Some of their bulk product, not under their name, is already being sold. Primitiv products should hit shelves of some dispensaries, along with the opening of their first dispensary in Niles, by the end of March. A second dispensary in Lansing, Michigan, is on track to open this summer.\n\n\"There will be different applications,\" Sims said. \"Whatever we find that is helpful for pain or CTE, we want people to be able to experience it in different formats.\"\n\nTHROUGH THEIR WORK WITH Ngwa and their partnership with NESTRE, which aims to improve brain health and mental wellness, Johnson and Sims are hoping to alter the cannabis space. Johnson is listed among NESTRE's industry partners and advisors alongside Julius Thomas, Josh McCown and Hue Jackson.\n\nSims went through the NESTRE program himself and believes together they can \"really find treatments for people.\" It's part of the broader vision Johnson and Sims have. They've spent years developing their partnerships and trying to figure out where they fit in the cannabis space they so passionately care about.\n\nJohnson sees massive health and pain-management benefits in the cannabis industry, both for the general public and for NFL players. Mike Rothstein\n\nThey believe they've found it. Through their own experiences in the NFL and business, they hope to provide something for current and future generations of athletes and people in chronic pain.\n\nThat's something many NFL players suffer from.\n\n\"To be able to provide solutions to guys that have been in our shoes and continue to be in our shoes, create solutions for those guys and just people in general,\" Johnson said. \"But definitely looking out for our counterparts and just dealing with pain and the neuroscience, we can really change the game and get on the leading edge of some of this nanotechnology.\n\n\"Create some of these products that are able to help these guys, people, veterans, anybody dealing with pain or neurocognitive disease. Anybody.\"", "meta_img": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F1004%2Fr13938_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9965474009513855}, "keywords": ["nfl", "calvin johnson", "rob sims", "marijuana", "cannabis", "hall of fame", "detroit lions", "NFL", "Detroit Lions", "daily"], "summary": "Johnson , left , and former Lions guard Rob Sims , right , have teamed up again -- this time in the cannabis industry , producing their own marijuana.

How did it do it, and what went into its toughest season yet?", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 07:20:42 EST", "body": "Editor's note: This story originally ran on Jan. 29 but has been updated and re-posted following Super Bowl LV, the final game of the 2020 season.\n\nChiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes had his barber tested for COVID-19 to ensure a safe trim. Then he turned to a game of Uno for late-night entertainment.\n\nFormer Lions QB Matthew Stafford spent a week isolated in a hotel, traveled by private plane to Minneapolis and started a game without taking a single practice snap.\n\nMichael Dunn, a Browns offensive lineman, prepared for a playoff start by working through drills in the parking lot of an apartment building. His girlfriend assisted by calling out faux signals.\n\nOn it went. The Broncos converted a practice-squad receiver on a day's notice to serve as a starting quarterback. Jets quarterback Sam Darnold put his extended family through NFL protocols so he could visit with them for Christmas. Coaching staffs around the league game-planned virtually for months, even when they were sitting in offices next door to each other at team facilities. And two head coaches even watched a game from home while interim coaches manned the sideline.\n\nNFL players and staff upended their lives to make it through the 2020 season, which came to an end on Feb. 7 with Super Bowl LV. They reprogrammed their long-held football habits, suspended their sense of competitive equity and embraced a well-funded and turbocharged version of the COVID-19 mitigation efforts that the entire country has been advised to follow.\n\nThe results were better than anyone could have imagined. When veterans reported to training camp on July 28, positive coronavirus cases in the United States had already reached 4.3 million in the four-plus months since the epidemic changed the country's way of life, and more than 140,000 people had died from the virus. (Nationwide cases have now surpassed 27 million.) Many questioned the viability of completing a full season, and those concerns only grew when an outbreak hit the Titans in Week 4. But in the end, the NFL postponed just five of its 256 regular-season games to allow outbreaks to run their course, and moved 10 others to accommodate them, but not a single game was canceled. How'd the league do it?\n\nBacked by an investment that sources said exceeded $100 million, the NFL and NFL Players Association built an infection control system so robust that they submitted multiple scientific papers to recommend applications outside of football -- including one that was published last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe overall league positivity rate of 0.076% since Aug. 1 -- 726 infections among 959,860 tests on an average of about 7,500 employees per week -- was far lower than the national average of 6.8% over a similar period, via data compiled by The Atlantic's COVID-19 tracking project. Even as the United States suffered through its worst public health crisis in a century, there were public reports of three hospitalizations for NFL personnel: one coach, one player and one referee. \"Our NFL facilities and team environments were some of the safest possible locations in those respective communities over the course of the season,\" said Dr. Allen Sills, the NFL's chief medical officer, in an interview with ESPN.\n\nThe effort was exhausting but might have to be repeated in at least a modified way next season, depending on the country's vaccine rollout and virus count in the coming months. Regardless, the pandemic pushed a typically slow-moving league into an era of innovation that will impact it for years to come.\n\n\"It took a concerted effort by everybody involved to be OK with doing things differently,\" said NFLPA president and Browns center JC Tretter. \"Getting over the fact that you're going to have to do things differently and then doing those things the right way. And as we know with COVID, if there is even an opening for someone not to live by that, it could cost us.\"\n\nThe NFL's history made its initial decision to play amid the pandemic \"suspicious\" to some in the public health community, said Eric S. Rubenstein, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Boston University School of Public Health. \"But in the end,\" he said, \"the lack of real serious morbidity and sickness is evidence that what they did worked for the people they cared about.\"\n\nManaging risk\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, the fundamental question surrounding professional sports was whether they should play as much as whether they could find a way to do it. Would it endanger players, coaches and their surrounding communities? Would it absorb medical resources intended for more vulnerable citizens?\n\nNFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith wrestled with the issue from ethical and moral positions. \"We don't do anything at all costs,\" he said.\n\nSills, a neurosurgeon whom the NFL hired in 2017 largely to manage its concussion protocols, said he was assured by owners and commissioner Roger Goodell that \"if at any point I felt, or any of our other advisers thought, it was unsafe to continue, they were certainly prepared to take action against that.\"\n\nMore broadly, Sills added, a physician's job in part is \"to help our patients coexist with illness or disability while trying to move forward with their lives. That's the nature of medical practice. Sometimes that's a self-limited short-term illness, maybe a short-term viral illness or a short-term spine problem -- a herniated disk, for example. Other times, it's a chronic illness. So as physicians, we come with the philosophy of, we want our patients to enjoy things that are meaningful in their lives while at the same time managing those conditions or mitigating any risk of injury or disability. So I think that's the same approach here.\"\n\nIn the end, the NFL and NFLPA possibly protected their employees and members better than if they had canceled the season and disbanded everyone to their home communities. They were highly motivated, of course, and spent millions of dollars to ensure they didn't lose the billions that come with a full 17-week season. (The NFL's television contracts cumulatively were worth nearly $10 billion in 2020.)\n\nWhen his season ended in January, in fact, Seahawks receiver Tyler Lockett expressed uncertainty about life without the league's inherent safeguards.\n\n\"You think about all the stuff that we've been through this whole year,\" he said. \"Having to be tested every day, having to try to stay away from as many people as we possibly can, being careful with who we fly up here and who we're around. Now, we literally have to go back to being at home, back into the real world. It's hard being in the real world when we have been away from it for so long, and now we have to figure out where we're going to go, who we're going to see, who we're not going to see.\"\n\nThe league and union decided last spring that they did not want, and could not achieve, the kind of \"bubble\" environment that allowed the NBA, WNBA, NHL and soccer to pull off modified seasons over the summer and fall. Instead, they assumed some of their players and coaches would get infected and built a plan around the tenets public health officials have emphasized: frequent testing, physical distancing, contact tracing and isolation of infected individuals, all while committing to frequent changes where necessary.\n\nThe league contracted with BioReference Laboratories Inc., which created a network of 32 on-site testing facilities and five labs across the country to guarantee results of the traditional nasal swab (PCR) tests within 24 hours. It purchased electronic trackers from Kinexon, required anyone inside a team facility or stadium to wear them and partnered with the medical data company IQVIA to analyze the data in real time to find close contacts to any infection. In most cases, contact tracers could upload a full set of close contacts to an infected individual within minutes after receiving notice of a positive test.\n\nThe NFL used Kinexon-produced tracking devices this season to accurately measure physical distancing and aid in contact tracing efforts. Zach Bolinger/Icon Sportswire\n\nWhile the league office reorganized its structure, pulling staff from other departments to serve on an 18-person contact-tracing group, each team was required to name an infection control officer (ICO) to serve as a point person. Teams retrofitted their facilities to ensure 6 feet of distance between players in locker and weight rooms; teams in warm weather areas (such as the Rams) built temporary outdoor meeting rooms to minimize the chance of spread. Most teams doubled the number of buses they used in travel and often added a second charter plane, all to facilitate physical distance guidelines while traveling.\n\nA key point came in September, when the NFLPA insisted on daily testing throughout the regular season to maximize the chance of catching every infection early enough to avoid spread among the team. Newly signed players, meanwhile, were required to return negative tests on at least five consecutive days before they were allowed to enter a team facility.\n\n\"I think if we don't test every day,\" Smith said, \"this season doesn't go on the way it did. We don't find the success we did of completing it in the time we had.\"\n\nIn the process of administering nearly 1 million tests through BioReference, the NFL and NFLPA contended that they did not undermine public access. \"We've set up a completely independent supply and logistic pipeline,\" Sills said when asked about the number of tests used. \"At no time during the entire season did we go and pursue testing with any existing health care agency or existing hospital. ... Our testing program was set up through an independent laboratory company with new supply and new distribution methods.\"\n\nIdentifying positive cases was only the first step. The league's COVID-19 task force not only traced the source of every infection but also endeavored to identify trends that could guide teams away from risky behavior. Dr. Christina Mack, the vice president of epidemiology and clinical evidence at IQVIA and an NFL consultant, said some of the early sources of team transmission came in small meeting rooms, from eating and drinking together, and even in carpools to the team facility. All were addressed in updated protocols over the course of the season.\n\nAdapting in-season\n\nFour other turning points arrived near midseason, when the league made cascading changes to its schedule after an outbreak among the Titans.\n\nFirst, the NFL found that 90% of its infections were visible in testing between two and five days after exposure. It also found, through contact tracing, multiple instances of transmission in less than 15 minutes of exposure. With that information, it created the classification of \"high-risk\" close contacts to find other ways to minimize the chance that someone would become infected and begin spreading the virus before it showed up in testing.\n\nRather than relying only on distance and exposure time, the approach added the setting, level of ventilation and whether the exposure came with or without masks. A short car ride without masks, for example, would be high-risk, but an extended exposure outside with masks would not. High-risk close contacts were all required to isolate for five days, even if they had tested negative and were showing no symptoms. That change left some teams decidedly undermanned in games -- most notably in Week 12, when the Ravens played the Steelers with a dozen players sidelined and the Broncos were forced to play without their top four quarterbacks -- but it halted some transmission chains.\n\nMore than 40 high-risk close contacts eventually tested positive during their five-day isolation, according to Sills.\n\nSecond, the league began conducting genomic sequencing tests, a process that allows scientists to map the virus structure of each infection. In practical terms, it meant the league could know with a high degree of accuracy whether multiple infections among a team were coming from the same source -- and thus there was spreading within the building -- or had been acquired from different places in the community. That information gave the NFL and NFLPA confidence to play even when teams were returning multiple positive tests in the days leading up to the games.\n\nThird, the league moved to intensive protocols that prohibited in-person meetings, required face coverings during practices and made all in-facility meals grab-and-go, among other things.\n\nFourth, it participated in the development process of a more accurate point-of-care test through Mesa Biotech that served as a supplemental security net for game days, allowing an extra data point of assurance before allowing players to participate.\n\nTaken together, according to the paper published by the CDC, these strategies have broad relevance beyond football. The data was especially relevant because nearly 40% of the league's confirmed positive tests were asymptomatic throughout their infections.\n\n\"Although the protocols implemented by the NFL were resource-intensive,\" the paper read, \"strategies such as accounting for specific characteristics of the close contact, in addition to time and duration, and creation of an intensive protocol are applicable to other settings, including essential workplaces, long-term care facilities, and schools.\"\n\n'The virus has not crossed the line of scrimmage'\n\nOf course, playing football in a pandemic requires at least some good fortune. In this case, the NFL benefited from the unexpected reality that games themselves -- three hours of players in close quarters, breathing heavily on each other -- were not spreading events. The NFL has not had a single infection traced to interaction during a game, according to Sills.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any transmission in a sporting competition anywhere around the world at this time,\" he added. \"Those things are sometimes difficult to prove when you don't have as much testing and epidemiology that we have, but certainly on the NFL side we have not had any transmission in our games. The virus has not crossed the line of scrimmage to our knowledge.\"\n\nThe most likely explanation, Sills said, was that players interacted in games frequently but for \"incredibly brief\" periods of time. Data trackers worn during games showed most interactions to be six seconds or less. Even when those contacts were added up, Sills said, they fell short of time needed for transmission, which varies by context according to the study published by the CDC.\n\nIncluding the playoffs, 43.9% of the NFL's 269 completed games this season had an official attendance (118). Some others had limited audiences with friends and family being invited into the stadiums. Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe size of stadiums and the ability to circulate air within them, outdoors or indoors, helped reduce risk as well. The NFL felt confident enough in the science of stadium size that it allowed its teams to work with state and local authorities to allow a limited number of fans to attend games if desired.\n\nDuring the regular season, 19 teams allowed 1,181,066 fans to attend games, and the Cowboys accounted for 197,313 of that total. The NFL said that no outbreaks had been reported based on attendance at NFL games anywhere in the country, but Rubenstein was among many public health officials who questioned the relevance of that claim. Contact tracing at NFL games was largely left to overwhelmed public health authorities who were unable to trace every infection.\n\nRubenstein said it was \"irresponsible\" to allow tens of thousands of people, in some cases, to gather for games and added: \"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\"\n\nBetween the start of training camp and the Super Bowl, at least 22 million people were infected with COVID-19 across the country, and nearly 315,000 have died. Sills said there was an \"incredibly low\" number of serious cases among league employees subject to its full testing program. Jaguars running back Ryquell Armstead, Broncos defensive coordinator Ed Donatell and referee Clay Martin were among a handful of people to be hospitalized.\n\nEarly concerns about the potential for long-term heart damage have yet to be realized. Every infected player and staff member underwent cardiac screening, but Sills said \"there was an incredibly low incidence of any kind of cardiac abnormality, and thankfully we did not have anyone who had a severe outcome from that.\"\n\nThe NFL, in fact, has joined other professional sports leagues in co-authoring a paper that Sills said will demonstrate a similar industrywide trend.\n\nMost NFL players are relatively low-risk candidates for severe illness because of the age group and physical conditioning, especially after 69 chose to opt out for medical or other reasons before the season. (The Patriots led the league with eight.) But the NFL also demonstrated how effective a motivated and well-funded community can be in fighting the virus, as well as the importance of across-the-board compliance.\n\n\"It's not easy. But it's not complicated. We know exactly what it takes to keep people safe. When I say it's not easy, what I mean is you have to apply it every single day consistently across the board with every single member of the organization. If you don't, then you're going to have that vulnerability.\" Dr. Allen Sills, the NFL's chief medical officer\n\n\"One of the things that I've said repeatedly is that I think risk mitigation is not complicated,\" Sills said. \"It's not easy. But it's not complicated. We know exactly what it takes to keep people safe. When I say it's not easy, what I mean is you have to apply it every single day consistently across the board with every single member of the organization. If you don't, then you're going to have that vulnerability.\"\n\n'It does take a toll on you'\n\nLike many players, Mahomes has made a habit over the years of getting his hair cut before games. That simple ritual required extra legwork in 2020. Before venturing in, he made sure to get his barber tested for COVID-19. The shop also needed to be empty when he arrived, Mahomes said late in the season. (During the week leading up to the Super Bowl, two Chiefs players -- center Daniel Kilgore and receiver Demarcus Robinson -- were required to isolate for five days after receiving a haircut from a barber who tested positive for COVID-19. Neither player was infected.)\n\nAfter-game rituals, meanwhile, largely dissipated. Some, like jersey swaps, were creatively replaced; the NFL partnered with Tide to cover the cost of mailing and replacing one jersey to another player. On a personal level, players and coaches dealt with the same feelings of social isolation as millions of others across the country and the world.\n\n\"When I would usually hang out with the guys and hang out with different people, even hang out with my family, I had to kind of prevent that as much as possible and keep it very minimal,\" Mahomes said. \"It does take a toll on you. You're used to being around people, enjoying stuff outside of football, enjoying stuff that's not always grind and work every single day. So you have to kind of find different ways to do that.\"\n\nOn one December night, that meant breaking out the Uno deck at home with his fianc\u00e9e, Brittany, and brother, Jackson.\n\nPeyton's Places Through conversations with former players, coaches and key figures, Peyton Manning gets to the heart of football history and its cultural impact. Watch on ESPN+\n\nAfter moving past the bubble concept over the summer, the NFL and NFLPA agreed to allow players and coaches to live at home and move about in the local community, while encouraging them to avoid high-risk conduct. Players were subject to fines, for example, if they participated in group events of more than three people when away from the facility. Ten Raiders players were fined between $15,000 and $30,000 apiece for taking off their masks while attending a charity function, and Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson was fined $7,500 after attending the opening of a restaurant with dozens of others.\n\nThat left players and coaches playing a lot more Uno and a lot fewer tracks at the spin table. Lions defensive coordinator Cory Undlin, who missed a Week 16 game because he was deemed a high-risk close contact to an infected person, said his routine for more than 170 consecutive days was the same: \"I go to the building, and I come home. I live by myself. I felt pretty good about being safe, but you never know.\"\n\nSimilar stories played out all across the league this season. Darnold said his parents and sister flew to New York from their home in Los Angeles to spend Christmas with him. Before they could see him, however, they needed to return negative test results. Through its teams, the NFL offered that service in part to protect their players and in part to address issues of mental health that could arise during the holidays.\n\nStafford, meanwhile, was deemed a high-risk close contact to someone who had tested positive in Week 9, requiring him to isolate for five days. That meant spending Tuesday through Friday nights in a hotel room in Michigan, with meals delivered to his door, unable to practice with the team or to visit his wife and children. If he continued to test negative throughout that process, Stafford would take a private plane to Minneapolis on Saturday, isolate in a hotel there and join the team Sunday for a game against the Vikings at U.S. Bank Stadium.\n\nOn the final night in his Michigan hotel, Stafford received a call that one of his daughters needed a trip to the hospital after falling off her high chair and onto a granite floor. His wife, Kelly, was initially unable to find someone who could stay with their other three children. So Stafford left the hotel, got in his car and headed home.\n\nAlong the way, he called Lions general manager Bob Quinn to tell him what was happening and confirm that if he entered his home, he would be breaking isolation early and thus be ineligible to play against the Vikings. When he was about a mile from home, his wife found someone to stay with the kids. Stafford turned around and returned to the hotel without breaking isolation.\n\nLions QB Matthew Stafford was nearly forced to break COVID-19 protocol when an issue came up at home in early November. But luckily it was avoided, and he was able to play in that week's game. Raj Mehta-USA TODAY Sports\n\n\"It's not something I take lightly,\" he said later. \"I understand it's a pandemic and people's health and safety are at risk, and I would feel terrible if I brought that in and infected a bunch of teammates or coaches or whatever it is. So I understand it. Doesn't make it easy, but everybody in the league is doing it. I just hate being away from my family, you know, and finish a practice, finish a game, go hug my daughters, hug my wife. That's what sometimes makes it worth it for me, and not being able to see them and hang with them has been really tough. But there's other people dealing with the same kind of stuff I am.\"\n\n'You can't play through COVID'\n\nUnexpected phone calls and overnight drama became the norm for NFL general managers and coaches. Testing cadence varied per team, but generally speaking, BioReference aimed to return results within 24 hours. Team ICOs often received them in the middle of the night, usually with instructions to spread the word immediately. In one isolated instance during Week 13, the Ravens received WR Dez Bryant's positive test result early enough to hold him out of a night game.\n\n\"Those phone calls at 3 o'clock in the morning when the testing gets done? Those were kind of fun, to see if you have a full house or there's a few people missing,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said.\n\nOn Oct. 3, the Saints traveled to Detroit for their game against the Lions the next day. At about 10:30 p.m. ET, after they arrived at the team hotel, the Saints learned that fullback Michael Burton's test from that morning had returned positive. By protocol, Burton was required to take an additional test, as were those who sat near him on the team charter.\n\nThose tests were completed just before 1 a.m., and, with a 1 p.m. kickoff looming, coach Sean Payton and several other team members stayed up past 3 a.m. to learn the results. Burton's original test proved to be a false positive, and the remainder were negative as well, and the game kicked off on time. Fully staffed but sleep-deprived, the Saints fell behind 14-0 before coming back for a 35-29 win.\n\nLike most coaches, Payton wasn't happy about the interruption to routine but made a point to say: \"That's just the way it is this season.\"\n\nIndeed, the entire NFL community was forced to accept what ordinarily would have been considered wildly unfair competitive disadvantages. The 49ers played without most of their receiving corps as well as left tackle Trent Williams in Week 9 against the Packers, losing 34-17, and later relocated to Arizona for the final five weeks of the season after regulations in their home county of Santa Clara, California, prohibited their continued operations. They lost four of their final five games.\n\nThe Broncos converted rookie receiver Kendall Hinton to quarterback in a matter of hours before a Week 12 game against the Saints, after learning the day before that starter Drew Lock and all three of his backups had gathered for a film session without wearing masks at a time when teammate Jeff Driskel was contagious. The Broncos lost 31-3. Also in Week 12, the Ravens lost a key AFC North game against the Steelers with quarterback Lamar Jackson among 12 players who were ineligible, a game that was delayed until Wednesday as the NFL awaited the end of the outbreak. For the Steelers, it was the second game of their season to be delayed multiple times because of outbreaks emanating from their opponent.\n\nThe Lions lost to the Buccaneers 47-7 in Week 16 after interim head coach Darrell Bevell, Undlin and three other assistants were ruled high-risk close contacts. And the Browns were forced to play their first playoff game since 2002 without coach Kevin Stefanski, who tested positive. (They won 48-37.)\n\nIn many cases, the NFL turned down requests from teams to push back games until key players were eligible. Goodell's blanket refusal, codified in an October memo to clubs, was a departure from his long-held ethos of competitive equity.\n\nGoodell has long sought to enforce the assertion that NFL competition is real and that outcomes aren't preordained or even titled by forces that would have the power to do so. In 2020, however, playing games when they were deemed safe took precedence.\n\n\"We had to abide by that principle to make it through this unique season and protect the health of the players and coaches and others,\" said Jeff Miller, the NFL's executive vice president of communications, public affairs and policy. \"There was no alternative. When that principle was put to the test, we consistently and regularly abided it. That was well known to the clubs, and the coaches and the players, and it had to be that way for us to be able to proceed through the regular season. Once we were comfortable and confident that the game was safe to be played, we moved forward. To do so otherwise was to create variability in that principle.\"\n\nKendall Hinton, a practice squad receiver and former college QB at Wake Forest, started under center for the Broncos in late November after the team's four rostered QBs were placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list. He went 1-of-9 with two interceptions. AP Photo/David Zalubowski\n\nPlayers, for one, had no argument.\n\n\"Guys want to be out there,\" Tretter said, \"and that was one of the tougher things this year. Guys play through injury, through illness, and this is a year that that's not possible. You can't play through COVID. It's not safe for the guys around you. And there's the choices or the choice is taken away from the player of, can you do it? It's a hard 'No.' And it's a hard no if you're a close contact.\"\n\nCould we see a repeat in 2021?\n\nThe severity of the pandemic has made long-term projections difficult and often heartbreaking. At the moment, all we can say about the NFL is that a return to normal operations seems far off. Soon, it will become a matter of not only health and safety but also labor relations.\n\n\"What does a post-COVID -- if there is such a thing as a post-COVID -- world look like?\" the NFLPA's Smith said. \"We can all imagine at some point, but the question is just when do we get there?\"\n\nThe answer to that question lies largely with the pace of national vaccinations. Based on the current rate and priorities, it's hard to know whether NFL players will be inoculated by the time training camps open this summer, or whether the NFLPA would agree to make the shots mandatory. (As of this week, the CDC has reported that approximately 34 million of the nation's 328 million people have received at least one dose of vaccine.) Regardless, current national guidelines suggest a continuation of mask wearing and distancing, as well as avoiding large indoor gatherings, even after receiving a vaccination.\n\nThat means the NFL and NFLPA must decide whether they should reapply 2020 protocols and conduct traditional offseason workouts and mini-camps at team facilities or should accept a second consecutive virtual offseason. Citing the success of the 2020 season, the union already is campaigning for a permanent overhaul to on-site offseason work.\n\nIn 2020, players spent their offseasons working out in home gyms, riding Peloton bikes and using exercise bands that the NFL allowed teams to provide them.\n\n\"There is always a balance between preparation and rest,\" Tretter said, \"and what we're seeing [in] more and more of the science is how important the rest is as you get your body right. Because again, we go through so much trauma for so long, to force guys into ramping back up so quickly after the season when we know it's not good for them just isn't right.\n\n\"I think you can prepare the way we did [in 2020]. I understand coaches, asking coaches whether you should take away practice is like asking the Cookie Monster if there should be less cookies. The answer is always going to be no, they want more. That is just kind of how it is, so that's not surprising. In the end, it's about building a better program -- building one that works for everybody involved and makes this game safer and our players healthier.\"\n\nTretter also cited the necessary shift of team meetings from in-person to virtual for much of the season as evidence that offseason work doesn't necessarily have to be on site. Naturally, coaches were split on the effectiveness of those virtual meetings. Patriots coach Bill Belichick said that his biggest takeaway from the 2020 protocols was \"the limited value of the virtual meetings and the maximum value of in-person meetings and walkthroughs.\" Stefanski of the Browns, meanwhile, said: \"We figured out a way to cover ground. ... It does not replace the physical work, but I think it is the next best thing.\"\n\nIn early January, Stefanski said it had been \"months\" since the Browns last had an in-person team meeting.\n\nLiving in hotels during training camp might be outdated as well, Tretter said. \"Another change that probably the public doesn't see but affects players is we weren't in the hotels this year,\" he said. \"We were back with our families. We were able to go home and be with them when otherwise we would be in the hotel. I think that's something that we've done constantly just because it's always been done that way. There's really no reason to do it.\"\n\nWill the 2021 season look the same as the 2020 season? And how will the NFL further adapt COVID-19 protocol? Rich Barnes-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIn the meantime, the NFL has largely scrapped its first major offseason event, the early-March scouting combine. In its place, the league has instructed teams to conduct physical tests during campus pro days. Interviews will be virtual, and medical checks will be administered at local facilities when possible.\n\nSmith said he expected that many of the league's 2020 innovations \"are things that we're going to take a hard look at and looking at trying to make them systemic and perpetual going forward.\" For now, however, it seems clear that there won't be much of a choice. Those innovations, and their next iterations, will be necessary to get through the spring, summer and perhaps early fall as well.\n\n\"We all hope optimistically that these sets of protocols can go the way of the Smithsonian at some point relatively soon,\" the NFL's Miller said. \"If not, we'll be prepared with a set of rules, and rules that evolve. We'll be prepared, and we'll do what's necessary.\"\n\nNFL Nation reporters Rich Cimini, Brady Henderson, Mike Reiss, Michael Rothstein and Adam Teicher all contributed to this story.

Where will Carson Wentz land? NFL Nation reporters make bold calls for the next few months.", "published": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 23:42:09 EST", "body": "With Super Bowl LV in the rearview, the 2021 NFL offseason is here, albeit an odd one. Amid the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, much -- if not all -- of the offseason will be virtual.\n\nWhile the annual scouting combine is essentially scrapped this year, the NFL draft will go on as planned at the end of April. And even before that, teams will navigate the salary cap in this year's mid-March free agency. Numerous teams could have new quarterbacks by next season, too. It promises to be a busy few months, and anything can happen. Expect the unexpected as all 32 NFL teams gear up for the 2021 season.\n\nWith that in mind, let's think outside the box a little bit. We asked our NFL Nation reporters to give us one big and bold prediction for the 2021 offseason. Nothing is off-limits, but keep in mind that these are adventurous suggestions of what might happen, rather than obvious or even highly probable outcomes. Our reporters imagined everything from a big Alabama reunion in Miami to the signing of an elite receiver by one AFC South team to an NFC East team adding a pass-rusher who tormented it this season to numerous QB movers and shakers. Let's jump in.\n\nJump to:\n\nARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN\n\nCLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND\n\nJAX | KC | LAC | LAR | LV | MIA | MIN\n\nNE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF\n\nSEA | TB | TEN | WSH\n\nAFC EAST\n\nThe Bills will not re-sign Matt Milano.\n\nThe outside linebacker hits free agency this offseason and is Buffalo's third home run from its 2017 class along with Tre'Davious White and Dion Dawkins -- both of whom already have received contract extensions. The Bills can't afford Milano, however, without shedding enough salary to make room for his projected $13.8 million-a-year salary. With a declining salary cap in 2021, Milano will be the first major homegrown player to leave Buffalo under Brandon Beane. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques\n\nThe Dolphins reunite an Alabama trio, drafting DeVonta Smith and Najee Harris to pair with Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nRoll Fins? The Dolphins spent the 2020 offseason building the trenches and finding their QB, and we're betting on Miami going all-in on Tagovailoa while surrounding him with two of the best offensive weapons in the draft. Miami currently has the No. 3 and No. 18 picks -- perfect landing spots for Smith and Harris, respectively, and maybe the Dolphins even trade back a few spots to nab them -- but it gives Tagovailoa a pair of much-needed explosive playmakers in two guys he had great chemistry and relationships with at Alabama. -- Cameron Wolfe\n\nJimmy Garoppolo will be the Patriots' quarterback in 2021.\n\nThis banks on the 49ers being willing to part with Garoppolo, a combination of his $25 million salary and injury history leading them to consider potential upgrades in an offseason when the QB shuffle across the NFL could be intriguing. If they do, it makes sense to think the Patriots would be at the front of the line to bring Garoppolo, who was the original succession plan to Tom Brady, back to New England. -- Mike Reiss\n\nThe Jets will trade QB Sam Darnold to the 49ers for second- and third-round picks.\n\nLooking for a veteran placeholder, the Jets will sign 49ers UFA C.J. Beathard, who played under new Jets offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur in San Francisco. Capping the quarterback makeover, the Jets will select BYU's Zach Wilson with the second overall pick. -- Rich Cimini\n\nAFC NORTH\n\nThe Ravens will sign Joe Thuney, one of the top guards in free agency.\n\nThe bigger splash would be landing wide receiver Allen Robinson II. But the bigger priority is bolstering the offensive line, based on what coach John Harbaugh and general manager Eric DeCosta said this offseason. Thuney, who played in New England last year under the franchise tag, has been among the most underrated interior linemen in the league. With his durability, grit and high character, Thuney would help fill the void of retired Pro Bowl guard Marshal Yanda, which Baltimore never really did last year. He's also an elite technician, allowing three sacks in the past three seasons. This will go a long way in improving the pass protection for Lamar Jackson. -- Jamison Hensley\n\nCornerback William Jackson III will get a massive contract -- and defensive end Carl Lawson walks.\n\nLawson stayed healthy in 2020 and showed how disruptive he can be. However, he will be a free agent this offseason and could be in line for a big contract from a team that will allow him to put up big numbers. That leaves more money for Jackson, a 2016 first-round pick who played well last season. Cincinnati has yet to see how the defense looks with Jackson and Trae Waynes as the starting corners. -- Ben Baby\n\nThe Browns will extend quarterback Baker Mayfield, making him one of the NFL's highest-paid players.\n\nComing into last season, Mayfield had plenty of doubters following a rough second season. But after guiding the Browns to their first playoff win in 26 years, while throwing 20 TDs with only 3 INTs after Week 6, Mayfield showed he's the franchise QB whom Cleveland has longed for these past two decades. As a result, the Browns will make sure he remains in Cleveland for the foreseeable future. -- Jake Trotter\n\nJ.J. Watt will sign with the Steelers.\n\nYes, the Steelers have more pressing needs than a defensive end and their cap situation hardly affords them the budget to bring in a star, even an aging one. But with the Watt brothers' emphasis on family and the vocal desire to play together, it's not that far fetched. With Watt already earning a massive amount of money in his decade in Houston, it's not unreasonable to think he could take a family discount to play his final years with his brothers. Imagine a Steelers defense that has both Watt brothers. It's not as distant a possibility as it once was. -- Brooke Pryor\n\nNote: This prediction has been changed after center Maurkice Pouncey announced his retirement on Friday.\n\nAFC SOUTH\n\nThe Texans will not trade quarterback Deshaun Watson.\n\nJust a few months ago, this wouldn't have even counted as a prediction, but things have taken a turn for the worse this offseason in Houston. Given how quickly the relationship between Watson and the team soured, it seems like this mini soap opera would eventually end in a trade. But the Texans want Watson to be their quarterback, and instead of trading him this offseason if he refuses to report, this could also end with Watson sitting out the season if the relationship isn't repaired. -- Sarah Barshop\n\nplay 1:02 Steve Young: Deshaun Watson has upper hand over Texans Steve Young and Booger McFarland analyze why the Texans insist Deshaun Watson won't be traded.\n\nThe Colts will trade up from the No. 21 spot to select their quarterback of the future.\n\nThis is if they don't land Philly's Carson Wentz or the Jets' Sam Darnold via trade. The Colts can't continue to take the one-year Band-Aid approach at the quarterback position and hope it'll help get them further in the playoffs while core players such as Darius Leonard and Quenton Nelson continue to get older. -- Mike Wells\n\nThe Jaguars will sign wide receiver Chris Godwin in free agency.\n\nThe Jaguars have the most money available (approximately $74 million) and they'll spend a good chunk of it adding another weapon for whichever QB they choose first overall. Godwin becomes the No. 1 in a group that includes DJ Chark Jr., Laviska Shenault Jr. and Collin Johnson. -- Michael DiRocco\n\nThe Titans will add a total of four edge rushers through free agency and the draft.\n\nGeneral manager Jon Robinson is well aware of the Titans' void at pass-rusher after the team finished with 19 sacks (30th in the NFL). Tennessee had only three outside linebackers active on game day for most of the season. The Titans will sign a mid-upper-level free-agent pass-rusher along with a bargain player and select two pass-rushers from this year's deep draft class. -- Turron Davenport\n\nAFC WEST\n\nThe Broncos will re-sign safety Justin Simmons.\n\nHe represents everything they say they want to do. At some point, if a franchise continues to tell the players in the locker room they will be rewarded if they play great, are quality ambassadors in the community and are frontline leaders in the building, then the team actually has to show it with the checkbook. Simmons is the player who gets everybody's attention inside the building; if the Broncos don't re-sign him then many will wonder what, exactly, can they do to be part of the team long-term if Simmons can't. -- Jeff Legwold\n\nThe Chiefs will find a way to re-sign wide receiver Sammy Watkins despite a tight salary-cap situation.\n\nThe Chiefs fought hard to get Watkins in 2018, when they signed him as a free agent, and fought hard to keep him last year on a restructured contract. Watkins is still only 27 and the Chiefs haven't made it a habit to move on from key players when they're at such a young age. -- Adam Teicher\n\nDerek Carr will not only remain a Raider, he will sign an extension with Las Vegas.\n\nYou wanted bold, right? Yeah, a theory has surfaced that Carr will be a \"hot commodity\" in the upcoming quarterback carousel, so desired he could command two first-round picks in trade. If that's the case, what are the Raiders waiting for? It's Carr Speculation Season and it will end, again, with the franchise's all-time passing leader staying put with the team that made him a second-round draft pick in 2014 and signed him to that five-year, $125 million extension in 2017. -- Paul Gutierrez\n\nThe Chargers will draft a new left tackle to make sure Justin Herbert is well protected and acquire a more reliable kicker this offseason.\n\nMore production up front will allow Herbert, who threw for an NFL rookie-record 31 touchdown passes last season, to continue his development. An upgrade from Michael Badgley, who connected on only 72.7% of his field goal attempts (24-of-33) and missed three extra points, could help the Chargers get over the hump in close games. -- Shelley Smith\n\nNFC EAST\n\nDak Prescott will not sign a contract extension.\n\nDespite both sides saying they want to get together with a multiyear commitment, the circumstances to get one done this offseason are much more difficult with a shrinking salary cap. How can they break the roadblock that has been there the past two offseasons? Without a long-term deal, Prescott will play the 2021 season on the franchise tag for the second straight year, earning $37.7 million and all but cementing a departure in 2022 with the franchise tag rising then to more than $52 million. -- Todd Archer\n\nplay 0:58 Foxworth: Dak should get out of Dallas Domonique Foxworth makes the case that Dak Prescott would be better off leaving the Cowboys.\n\nFree-agent edge rusher Haason Reddick will fill a massive Giants hole.\n\nThe top of this year's draft doesn't necessarily align with New York's need at edge rusher, so the Giants look to free agency and add an ascending player with explosiveness. Reddick showed in their Week 14 matchup (5 sacks) what he can bring to the table. And as Joe Judge likes to say, show me what a player can do, not what he can't. Reddick can rush the passer and provide speed off the edge. He had 12.5 sacks this past season. The Giants need that. -- Jordan Raanan\n\nPhiladelphia will draft a quarterback in the first round to compete with Jalen Hurts.\n\nWould the organization really end one quarterback controversy by trading Carson Wentz, just to invite another? That will be a question to grapple with between now and April's draft. The opportunity could be too good to pass up. The Eagles hold the No. 6 pick and obviously hope they're not selecting that high again anytime soon. If they identify a franchise QB, they could pounce while they have the chance. -- Tim McManus\n\nQuarterback Alex Smith will want to keep playing -- but he won't be doing it in Washington.\n\nSmith was clearly rejuvenated by returning to the field last year -- and buoyed by how his leg felt, and how he was moving in the pocket, prior to the bone bruise injury. Washington went 5-1 with him and valued his leadership. But the franchise wants to improve at the position and there are concerns if he can last all 16 games and play at a consistent level. It's still possible he returns, at a reduced salary, if Washington can't find another quarterback to pair with Kyle Allen and Taylor Heinicke (or Steven Montez). And it won't mortgage the future to land one. -- John Keim\n\nNFC NORTH\n\nThe Bears will let wide receiver Allen Robinson II walk in free agency.\n\nRobinson has been a great player for the Bears, but the team balked at extending the 27-year old receiver last year. Robinson is looking for top wide receiver dollars. Chicago values Robinson, but obviously not at that price. The Bears seem content to allow Robinson to test the market. If Robinson finds a team willing to pay big money, he's gone. -- Jeff Dickerson\n\nWith Jared Goff on the roster, the Lions won't draft a quarterback.\n\nConsidering all the needs Detroit has as it reconstructs its roster, acquiring Goff in the Matthew Stafford trade at least gives the Lions a competent quarterback for the immediate future. And if Goff can rejuvenate his career with Detroit -- something no one will know until the end of 2021 at least -- then the position becomes much less necessary. But with gaping holes at receiver and every position on the defense other than cornerback, the Lions focus on young, impact defenders in the draft and push the quarterback question to the 2022 offseason, where the team currently has two first-round picks. -- Michael Rothstein\n\nAaron Rodgers will skip the offseason workouts -- assuming there are any.\n\nRodgers has participated every year -- and yes, he has a $500,000 workout bonus -- but if he truly wants to exercise his leverage and get the Packers to commit more guaranteed money to him over the remaining years of his deal, then this could be his course of action if nothing gets done before the offseason program begins. -- Rob Demovsky\n\nThe Vikings will be part of the quarterback carousel in free agency.\n\nIf Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers really want Kirk Cousins, now's the time for Minnesota to pull off a trade that will create freedom to reconstruct other parts of the roster. The Vikings could get out of the financial commitment they made to Cousins when he signed a two-year extension last March that comes with a $31 million cap hit for 2021 and go a different direction at the position. If that comes in the form of Jimmy Garoppolo and a second-round pick (they currently don't have one), the Vikings should jump at the opportunity. -- Courtney Cronin\n\nNFC SOUTH\n\nThe Falcons' first draft pick will be a quarterback.\n\nMatt Ryan is 36. Although he's still playing at a high level and has several more productive years ahead of him, it's time to start preparing for the future. New GM Terry Fontenot and coach Arthur Smith have the fourth overall pick; if the Jets pass on a QB at No. 2, they'll snag Justin Fields and let him learn for a year or so under Ryan. -- Michael DiRocco\n\nThe Panthers will find a way to trade for Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson.\n\nHe wants out of Houston even though the organization insists he won't be traded. The Panthers will do whatever it takes, even if that means offering three first-round picks and possibly a star player, although including Christian McCaffrey seems unlikely. But as ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper said, it would be worth throwing in McCaffrey if necessary to get a franchise quarterback. -- David Newton\n\nJameis Winston will win the Saints' starting quarterback job -- and go on to win his first playoff game.\n\nSean Payton has made no secret about the Saints' desire to re-sign Winston and allow him to compete with Taysom Hill for the starting job after Drew Brees retires. And there is obviously still a ton of potential there with Winston, who just turned 27, if they can cure his turnover issues. It doesn't hurt that New Orleans still has one of the NFL's deepest and most talented rosters. -- Mike Triplett\n\nplay 1:17 What moves do the Bucs need to make this offseason? Dan Graziano sees the Buccaneers extending Tom Brady's contract in order to land other free agents.\n\nMultiple high-priced Bucs players will restructure their existing contracts to keep as much of the team together as possible.\n\nMike Evans, Ali Marpet, Donovan Smith and Ryan Jensen are among the six highest-paid players on the team under contract in 2021 and are candidates to restructure. At this point, anyone can be a restructuring candidate, although the amount of work they'll have to do won't be known until the new salary cap comes out. -- Jenna Laine\n\nNFC WEST\n\nThe Cardinals will not re-sign cornerback Patrick Peterson.\n\nThat means they'll have to rebuild a key part of their secondary. Peterson, who'll be 31 when next season starts, wants another big deal, but the Cardinals are unlikely to give him the type of money he's seeking. By not re-signing, Peterson will hit free agency and the open market for the first time in his career. Without Peterson, the Cardinals will have to find his replacement, which is easier said than done since he was an elite corner -- and one of the best in the league for a few years. -- Josh Weinfuss\n\nThe Rams, despite a lack of cap space and draft capital, will piece together the means to bring in a speedy receiver.\n\nThey need one who can stretch the field for new quarterback Matthew Stafford. This was next in line after the boldest possible prediction has already come to fruition, when the Rams moved on two weeks after the season from franchise quarterback Jared Goff, sending him -- along with two first-round picks and a third-round pick -- to the Lions in exchange for Stafford. -- Lindsey Thiry\n\nNFL on ESPN+ Access elite coverage for every fan: highlights of the biggest games, original series from NFL legends, unprecedented analysis and more. Sign up now to unlock everything ESPN+ has to offer.\n\nThe 49ers will draft a quarterback some time in the first three rounds to push and provide depth behind ... Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\nWith the 12th pick, the easiest path would be for one of the top four signal-callers to fall to the Niners, but if that doesn't happen, they could be in striking distance for a trade up or they could target someone else by moving back from 12 or up from one of their other spots. Regardless, the Niners need to find someone with long-term upside who can push Garoppolo and be capable of stepping in should Garoppolo continue to struggle with injuries. -- Nick Wagoner\n\nThe Seahawks will either make Jamal Adams the NFL's highest-paid safety or trade him.\n\nThe most likely outcome is Seattle keeping Adams long term on an extension that tops Budda Baker's $14.75 million average, but how much more than that will he insist on making? Adams will presumably want to be paid more like a pass-rusher than a safety after setting the league's single-season sack record for a defensive back. When the Seahawks acquired Adams last summer and put off extension talks until this offseason, they figured that if they couldn't get a deal done, they could trade him as a last resort. -- Brady Henderson", "meta_img": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F0209%2Fr812862_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9912601113319397}, "keywords": ["nfl", "offseason", "NFL", "list"], "summary": "With a declining salary cap in 2021 , Milano will be the first major homegrown player to leave Buffalo under Brandon Beane --. \n\n While the annual scouting combine is essentially scrapped this year , the NFL draft will go on as planned at the end of April."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "2700434c-408a-42d1-b86b-efad58389be3", "source": "espn", "data": {"title": "Highlights from the Buccaneers' Super Bowl victory parade", "link": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30874037/highlights-tampa-bay-buccaneers-super-bowl-victory-parade", "description": "Title belts?

What can we expect from the NFL, NFLPA and teams over the next few months?", "published": "Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:13:52 EST", "body": "A most unique and exhausting NFL season -- one that followed a most unique and exhausting offseason -- is over. The NFL and the NFL Players Association can take a breath.\n\nThey just better make it a quick one. The COVID-19 pandemic will shape the 2021 offseason as well, and both the league and the union will carry their protocols into the spring, summer and possibly the fall. As a result, the league's traditional offseason calendar remains largely to be determined.\n\nThe nature of the 2021 NFL draft, player workouts, mini-camps, training camp and the preseason are in the air. The league's official page of key dates, in fact, contains only two: the March 1 deadline for draft-eligible college players to announce their return to college and the April 29-May 1 draft.\n\nOne way or the other, the NFL will need to plow through a long list of offseason priorities. Here are 15 of them.\n\nFinalize plans for a 17-game season\n\nOwners have already started the process of adding an extra game to the regular season, a right they won during the 2020 collective bargaining agreement (CBA). They agreed in December on the schedule machinery, announcing that the 17th game will be an interconference matchup based on divisional standings during the prior year, but held off on a final vote.\n\nCommissioner Roger Goodell did not provide a fully committed answer last week at the Super Bowl when asked whether a 17-game schedule would start in 2021. But given the revenue reduction that owners incurred during the pandemic in 2020, it's a logical assumption that they will seek all possible revenue streams moving forward. The additional week of the regular season would provide it, and a vote could happen in the coming months.\n\nStructure the offseason\n\nBecause of the ongoing pandemic, the NFL is faced with another plan-as-you go offseason. Its first big tentpole event, the annual scouting combine that typically opens in late February, has largely been scrapped in its conventional form. Players will work out and receive medical exams on or near their college campuses, and interviews will be virtual in most cases.\n\nThe rest of the offseason will be based on public health conditions. The draft is scheduled for April 29-May 1 in Cleveland, but its format -- whether it is on-site, virtual as it was in 2020 or a combination of the two -- hasn't been determined.\n\nWe can say with some certainty that the Jacksonville Jaguars will select Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence at No. 1 overall. The New York Jets could select a quarterback with the No. 2 pick, or they could stick with starter Sam Darnold and trade the pick to accumulate more draft capital.\n\nBased on the CBA, in-person offseason workouts for teams with new coaches could start in early April. But the NFL and the NFLPA will need to weigh the value of those workouts, and later organized team activities (OTA) and minicamps, against the effort it would take to make them safe.\n\nRemember, the 2020 season was played after an entirely virtual offseason. Last week, Goodell said: \"Virtual is going to be a part of our life for the long term.\"\n\nPlan for COVID-19 vaccines and negotiate a deal on them\n\nAt the moment, the country's vaccine rollout has little relevance for conventional NFL operations. The earliest opportunity for players to be in team facilities again is more than two months away.\n\nBut at some point, the NFL and NFLPA will have to answer the same questions that many other workplaces will face. Will vaccination be mandatory? Will there be exceptions? What percentage of a team must be vaccinated to reduce overall risk? And what restrictions can be lifted when a team is all or mostly vaccinated?\n\nFind homes for all the QBs\n\nWe've already seen one blockbuster quarterback trade, with Matthew Stafford moving to the Rams and Jared Goff flipping to the Lions. But the NFL offseason could be dominated by quarterback transition, headlined by the Texans' Deshaun Watson, who has asked for a trade. The Bears, 49ers, Panthers, Patriots, Colts, Jaguars, Jets, Saints, Broncos and Washington Football Team could all replace their 2020 starters or draft presumptive replacements.\n\nplay 1:30 Schefter expects Wentz deal in the coming days Adam Schefter breaks down the Eagles possibly trading Carson Wentz in the next few days.\n\nThe Eagles are reportedly considering a trade of Carson Wentz. The Steelers' Ben Roethlisberger will need to renegotiate his contract to return. The Packers say they want Aaron Rodgers back, and Rodgers said: \"I don't think that there is any reason why I wouldn't be back,\" but added: \"There's not many absolutes in this business.\"\n\nIn all, 40% of the league could face a transition at the game's most important position.\n\nDetermine the 2021 salary cap number\n\nLike many businesses, the NFL's revenues dropped significantly during the pandemic, largely because of limitations on attendance. By definition, lower 2020 revenues mean the team spending limits will fall in 2021.\n\nThe NFL and NFLPA agreed last spring to a minimum cap floor of $175 million per team, but that doesn't necessarily have to be the final number. (It was $198.2 million in 2020.) The final number is likely to be around $180 million, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported.\n\nRegardless, teams have had plenty of time to prepare for a drop, and some have done so by hoarding larger amounts of space than normal to roll over into 2021. But the final cap number, to be negotiated as always with the NFLPA and released sometime in late February or early March, will provide a critical guide rail for the rest of the offseason.\n\nConduct free agency\n\nOne offseason tentpole that doesn't hinge on public health is the free-agent market, which is expected to open in mid-March. The lowered cap could prove disappointing for some players and teams, but at the moment, there are some intriguing names with expiring contracts. Atop the list is Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, who is expected to be fully healed from a dislocated ankle by the start of the 2021 season. But the Cowboys want to re-sign him and could use a second consecutive franchise tag to prevent him from leaving.\n\nTraditionally, teams can start tagging one franchise or transition player in mid-February.\n\nAs it stands now, the 2021 class will be heavy on wide receivers. Some will re-sign with their current teams before the market opens. But for now, the list includes Kenny Golladay, Allen Robinson, Chris Godwin, Corey Davis, A.J. Green, JuJu Smith-Schuster, Curtis Samuel and Will Fuller.\n\nFigure out the preseason\n\nPart of the presumption for a 17-game regular season is a reduction of the traditional preseason schedule of four weeks (plus the Hall of Fame game). But it's way too early to know whether the NFL and NFLPA will want, or be able, to have a preseason at all in 2021. The NFL canceled the entire preseason in 2020, preferring to focus on ramping up conditioning in training camp instead. It has since learned that games are not major spreaders of the virus, but the value of playing games that don't count in the remnants of a pandemic remains an open question.\n\nAddress permanent NFLPA requests\n\nThe union has already suggested that some of the league's pandemic-influenced innovations should become permanent. Atop the union's list is emphasizing a virtual offseason over in-person workouts. Late in the season, NFLPA president JC Tretter wrote in a blog post that players would be better served by working virtually in the offseason, reducing wear and tear on their bodies and presumably allowing them to be fresher at the end of the season. He also wrote in favor of the 2020 training camp format that built in a long ramp-up period before full-contact practices began.\n\nSome of the data analysis has yet to be done. Injury data, especially as it relates to soft-tissue ailments such as muscle pulls, will help flesh out the effectiveness or limitations of virtual preparations. And it's quite possible that the pandemic will render this issue moot for the 2021 offseason. But the union has been pushing for less offseason work for more than a decade and is unlikely to drop this opportunity to continue.\n\nAbsorb fallout from coaching cycle\n\nA significant push to diversify hiring outcomes for leadership positions produced a disappointing final result this winter, meaning the NFL has more work to do this offseason. Teams did give the general manager title to three Black men: Martin Mayhew (Washington), Brad Holmes (Lions) and Terry Fontenot (Falcons). But only two of the seven head-coaching hires were minorities: David Culley (Texans) and Robert Saleh (Jets). In all, the league will have three Black head coaches and a total of five minorities in the position for the 2021 season.\n\n\"It wasn't what we expected,\" Goodell said last week, \"and it's not what we expect going forward.\"\n\nThose results came after the league expanded its Rooney Rule requirements to include, among other things, a requirement to interview at least two external candidates for head coach openings, and at least one external minority candidate for open coordinator jobs. It also incentivized teams to develop minority candidates by awarding them two third-round draft choices if one of their coaches or executives was hired into a head coach or general manager job. Goodell said the league will revisit discussions this spring to delay any hires until after the Super Bowl, a rule that would slow down the process and prevent teams from skipping past candidates who are still coaching in early February.\n\nBut there is a fundamental obstacle to achieving the kind of diversity that Goodell and others in the league office want: They can design rules to require a diverse pool of candidates, and offer incentives for teams that develop the talent, but they can't force owners to make certain hires. That part will never change.\n\nplay 0:36 What David Culley is bringing to the Texans Sarah Barshop explains why Houston hired David Culley as its next head coach.\n\nMaintain social justice energy\n\nLost in the NFL's pandemic response was a groundbreaking moment for the league over the summer. In response to a challenge from some of the game's most high-profile players, Goodell admitted the NFL erred in its attempts to silence peaceful protests in 2016 and the years that followed.\n\nGoodell's comments came as the nation dealt with the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Four police officers have been charged in his death and await trial.\n\nThe league allowed teams and players to affix slogans such as \"End Racism\" to their game uniforms and relaxed other rules to allow more freedom of expression in public, among many other initiatives. The league reported last month that its contributions toward a 10-year, $250 million social justice commitment have already reached $95 million.\n\nIt will be incumbent on the league to continue pushing forward in this space, and not just in reaction to specific national events. And the issues of race and protest remain complicated within the NFL. Quarterback Colin Kaepernick never got a job, even as a backup, after he initiated kneeling protests among players during the 2016 season. More recently, the complexity has been highlighted not only by the disappointing coaching cycle but also a lawsuit by former players who allege the league's concussion settlement payout process \"explicitly and deliberately\" discriminates against Black players who have filed dementia-related claims.\n\nEvaluate penalty drop, especially offensive holding\n\nThe NFL officiating department decided to artificially reduce the number of flags thrown in 2020, an unexpected shift that was largely welcomed by fans and other external observers. Total flags were down 18.8%, including 40.7% for offensive holding, from 2019. The reaction was more complicated inside the league, however. Coaches and players were caught off-guard, knowing that the decision was a true difference-maker. In fact, the shift was perhaps the biggest reason why the league set a record for points per game.\n\nBy the end of the season, line play in some games more closely resembled professional wrestling, as offensive linemen seemed less fearful of holding penalties. Teams with big financial commitments to defensive players worried that their investment would be neutralized by the shift in rule interpretation. They don't necessarily want more penalties, but they do want to know whether the league will make this standard permanent at least into the near future.\n\nThe final two weeks of the postseason provided an appropriate capstone. Officials in the NFC Championship Game allowed heavy contact between receivers and defensive backs to go unpenalized. In the AFC Championship Game, replay officials reversed an unreviewable play. And in Super Bowl LV, referee Carl Cheffers' crew tightly officiated contact in the defensive backfield. More than anything, teams just want to know the standard for legal play -- and for it to be enforced consistently.\n\nRevisit the sky judge concept\n\nLast spring, NFL teams proposed multiple versions of a sky judge to supplement on-field officials and help avoid obvious missed calls. Owners never voted on them, but the competition committee made plans to experiment during the preseason with increased communication between the existing replay official and the referee. That plan was rendered moot by the cancellation of the preseason. The arrangement, if made permanent, would codify the informal discussions that some referees already have with their replay officials.\n\nMany coaches are big proponents of sky judges, versions of which have worked in both the AAF and the XFL, and these types of suggestions aren't likely to fade away.\n\nRevive onside kick alternative\n\nSuccess rates for onside kicks dropped after a 2018 rule change to make the kickoff safer, a worrisome trend for owners who rightly value the entertainment value of late-game comebacks. In both 2019 and 2020, they considered proposals for a different way to maintain possession after a score. Both revolved around the idea of giving the scoring team one play to gain 15 yards from its own 25-yard line, instead of a kickoff. They rejected the 2019 proposal, experimented with it in the 2019 Pro Bowl and tabled it in 2020, but the factors that motivated them only accelerated in 2020.\n\nTeams attempted 67 onside kicks in 2020, the third-highest total since at least 2001, but recovered only three, the lowest total during that period. The league has waited three years to see whether coaches and players could make adjustments on their own. It appears a rule intervention is necessary.\n\nDetermine attendance parameters\n\nPandemic restrictions led to a 92% drop in NFL game attendance from 2019, a trend that owners will be highly motivated to reverse in 2021. Their strategy for the Super Bowl was instructive. They filled about 25% of Raymond James Stadium's capacity with ticket-buying fans, sitting in pods with masks and other restrictions, and then added an additional 7,500 fully vaccinated health care workers to bring total attendance to about 25,000.\n\nThe NFL isn't likely to have a plan in place until late this summer, and much of it will depend on vaccine distribution around the country. As in 2020, some teams' plans could change during the course of the season. But you can bet the league will do everything it can to sell every ticket it can in 2021.\n\nResolve Washington Football Team investigation and dispute\n\nOn the field, Washington had an uplifting season. It won the NFC East and platformed two heartwarming stories with the comeback of quarterback Alex Smith and the cancer fight of coach Ron Rivera. Off the field, however, it had a brutal year.\n\nFirst, the NFL is awaiting completion of an investigation into years of allegations of sexual harassment in the workplace. It is uncertain what attorney/investigator Beth Wilkinson has found, and Goodell said last week that he has yet to meet with her, but any violations of NFL policy would result in organizational discipline.\n\nSecond, an increasingly personal dispute has developed between owner Daniel Snyder and his minority ownership partners, who are trying to sell their shares of the team. The league wants desperately to settle the quarrel quietly in arbitration, rather than in courtrooms, without the public airing of any more squabbling.", "meta_img": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F0208%2Fr812379_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.7299396991729736}, "keywords": ["nfl", "offseason", "free agency", "nfl draft", "NFL", "daily", "Fantasy NFL"], "summary": "The draft is scheduled for April 29 - May 1 in Cleveland , but its format -- whether it is on - site , virtual as it was in 2020 or a combination of the two -- has n't been determined.

Like when I watch them play, it looks fun, it looks easy,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"It looks simple. For sure, they look like us last year, and man, when you're at that point and you're playing with that confidence, you're hard to beat for sure.\"\n\nLike last season's Bucks, the Jazz (21-5) have the best record in the NBA. They've won 17 of their past 18 games, with the first victory of that stretch also coming against the Bucks on Jan. 8.\n\nRudy Gobert and Joe Ingles had 27 points apiece, and Donovan Mitchell added 26 points with eight assists and six rebounds. Jordan Clarkson went for 25 points off the bench.\n\nIngles said they would take a minute to celebrate the victory, but then after that it would be back to business.\n\nDonovan Mitchell and the Jazz are 17-1 in their past 18 games. \"We don't want to be the best team in February,\" Mitchell said. \"We want to be the best team in July.\" Photo by Jeff Swinger/NBAE via Getty Images\n\n\"I don't think we're that satisfied just yet,\" said Ingles, who went 7-for-9 from 3-point range.\n\nThat's because their goals are much bigger than the regular season, especially after last season, when they blew a 3-1 lead to Denver and were eliminated in the first round.\n\n\"We don't want to be the best team in February; we want to be the best team in July,\" Mitchell said.\n\nBeing respected in the top role is still something new for Mitchell and his teammates. As the leaders in Utah, Mitchell's and Gobert's paths to becoming NBA All-Stars were not always written in stone, and they've developed an underdog mentality that has carried over to the team.\n\n\"It's different in my four years. You look at all of us and each individual story ... [we were] underrated,\" Mitchell said. \"I think now we're at a point where people are coming at us, and the way we've responded to that is very impressive. I think there's a lot more we can do to continue to get better, but it doesn't hurt to be in the moment and understand that what we're doing is pretty cool.\"\n\nThe road doesn't get much easier for Utah, with the Miami Heat, Philadelphia 76ers and back-to-back games against the LA Clippers up next. Then it's Charlotte on Feb. 22, followed by the Los Angeles Lakers on Feb. 24 and the Heat again Feb. 26.\n\nAlthough the emphasis might not be on the regular season, the Jazz know they can't bypass it, either.\n\nHowever, Jazz coach Quin Snyder said, \"Nobody is beating their chest about anything that we've done.\n\n\"Frankly you never want to do that and it's never appropriate unless you're the last team standing.

Obviously, that's an amazing accomplishment, and being in that conversation with all that we've been through these last two years, that means something. Those narratives make themselves as you go throughout the season, and my job is obviously just be at the level that I expect to be, and usually that means you're at the top at the end of the season.\n\n\"I really try not to get distracted by that because it kind of taints the moment. And really right now, if I'm doing my job, then I'll be there at the end of the season, and that will take care of itself.\"\n\nAfter hitting 10 3-pointers on Thursday night, Curry has made at least 10 3s in 17 games, extending his NBA record. Warriors swingman Klay Thompson sits in second with five such games.\n\n\"It is routine, which is the crazy part of it,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said of Curry's latest offensive outburst. \"You just come to expect it. And these 3s that he hits when there's just nothing there offensively and he just uses his dribble to free himself up, not exactly with a ton of space, just a few inches of space, and then he rises up and you expect every single one of them to go in. It's kind of crazy. He's in a really good groove.\"\n\nAsked whether Curry belongs in the MVP conversation, Kerr, who has said repeatedly in the past week that he feels Curry is playing the best basketball of his career, was blunt in his assessment.\n\n\"I think so,\" Kerr said. \"How could he not be? He's otherworldly.\"\n\nThe one thing that appears to be holding Curry back from garnering more momentum for the award is the Warriors' 14-12 record. When asked if a team's win-loss record should be taken into consideration, Curry offered a measured response.\n\n\"It always has and it always will,\" he said. \"You can always make judgments based on what you value and what you see and numbers and wins and losses and the eye test and all that type of stuff. It's kind of what makes the beauty of that award in general because everybody has a different take on what it means. Sometimes the goalposts do change, though, for sure. So it's just a matter of doing my job, and if that means people want to put me in that conversation or any of the other guys, then that's amazing. If not, it's not going to change how I approach the game.\"\n\nCurry's ability to hit shots from all over the floor continues to leave his teammates in awe. Even they can't seem to process what kind of tear the guard is on.\n\n\"It's literally like a video game,\" Warriors swingman Juan Toscano-Anderson said. \"We're all on the bench chuckling and laughing like, 'Man, he's unreal.'\"\n\nFellow Warriors swingman Andrew Wiggins echoed a similar sentiment, saying that he believes Curry has proved to be the best player in the league so far this season.\n\n\"The stuff he does even with two, three defenders on him, how he still gets his shot up and makes it,\" Wiggins said. \"The space he creates, it doesn't matter who's guarding him. It's just a joy to watch. It's one thing to watch on TV, and it's another thing to actually be here, living it. ... He's on his own level right now.\"\n\nCurry admitted this is one of the best stretches of his 12-year career.\n\n\"100 percent,\" Curry said. \"But it's all about what's happening now.

(1:58)\n\nThree of the brightest young stars in the NBA put on a show Friday night as Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis of the Dallas Mavericks and Zion Williamson of the New Orleans Pelicans posted an array of dazzling numbers.\n\nDoncic had a career-high 46 points and 12 assists, Porzingis had 36 points and eight 3-pointers (both season highs) and Williamson had a career-high 36 points on 14-of-15 shooting as the Mavericks won 143-130, their fourth straight victory.\n\nAdd in the Pelicans' Brandon Ingram, who scored 30, and it was the first time in NBA history that four players age 25 or younger each had 30 or more points in a regulation game, according to Elias Sports Bureau research. Doncic and Williamson became the second pair of opposing players, each 21 or younger, to both score at least 35 in the same game. Kevin Durant (46 for the Thunder) and Eric Gordon (41 for the Clippers) did it on Jan. 23, 2009, also according to Elias Sports research.\n\nDoncic dominant\n\nDoncic, who had tied his career high with 42 points last Saturday in a high-scoring showdown with Steph Curry, became the fourth player with 45 points and 10 assists in a game at age 21 or younger, joining Trae Young, Isiah Thomas and Michael Jordan, according to Elias.\n\n\"Luka went on a run where he hit four or five, like, tough, contested 3-pointers,\" Williamson said. \"There's not really a defensive scheme you can do for that. That's a great player hitting tough shots.\"\n\nplay 0:34 Doncic twirls and hits step-back jumper over Hernangomez Luka Doncic takes advantage of a mismatch and sinks a midrange shot over Willy Hernangomez.\n\nIt was the 13th straight 25-point game for Doncic, the third-longest streak by a player at age 21 or younger in NBA history. Only Durant (29 in 2009-10) and LeBron James (16 in 2006) have had longer streaks at age 21.\n\nDoncic is the only player in Mavericks history with 40 points and 10 assists in a game -- and he has done it eight times (seven in the regular season, one in the playoffs).\n\nDynamic duo\n\nDoncic and Porzingis combined to score or assist on 103 points, and Doncic scored on all eight half-court defenders he faced. Porzingis was 4-for-5 (all 3-pointers) off Doncic passes. Overall, the Mavericks were 12-for-17 off Doncic's passes.\n\n\"Tonight was one of those games where things were clicking for both of us, and he's finding me open on the 3-point line,\" Porzingis said. \"It gives both of us energy and just builds the momentum for both of us and the team when we get going like that and we're knocking down shots and making that extra pass. It just felt easy and natural. Not every game is going to be like that, but I believe that we're on the right path.\"\n\nplay 0:42 Porzingis beats halftime buzzer with another deep ball Kristaps Porzingis stays hot from beyond the arc as he sinks the triple as time expires in the first half.\n\n\"They're both great offensive players. They're both very unique. They fit together extremely well,\" Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. \"Their games complement one another very well. The chemistry tonight was tremendous. Balls were delivered on time, on target -- people stepping into shots in rhythm. It was great stuff to watch.\"\n\nDoncic, who was born in Slovenia, and Porzingis, of Latvia, became the first teammates born outside of the United States to each score 35 or more points in a game. Their 82 combined points are the second most in history by a pair of teammates born outside of the 50 states and the most ever in a regulation game, according to Elias Sports research. (Tim Duncan and Tony Parker of the Spurs combined for 85.)\n\nZion nearly perfect\n\nWhile he missed his one shot outside the paint, Williamson went 14-for-14 in the paint. The only player with more makes without a miss in the paint in a game over the past 25 seasons is Hakeem Olajuwon in 1998.\n\n\"Williamson was ridiculous. I mean, unbelievable what he can do on a basketball floor,\" Carlisle said.\n\nplay 0:23 Mavs leave Zion unmarked and he makes them pay Zion Williamson drives the baseline and rises for the two-handed jam.\n\nWilliamson joins Derrick Rose as the only players 20 or younger to go 10-for-10 or better in a half over the past 25 seasons. Rose was 10-for-10 in the second half on March 18, 2009, at the Thunder.\n\nWilliamson is the youngest player in NBA history with a game of at least 30 points on 90% shooting or better, surpassing Dwight Howard, according to Elias Sports research.\n\nThe ugly side\n\nWhile all the gaudy numbers are fun for fans to look at, they figure to give both coaches nightmares as they try to coax some defense from their teams. The Pelicans allowed 50 3-pointers in their past two games, the most allowed by any team in a two-game span in NBA history. (In addition to the 25 made by the Mavs, New Orleans also gave up 25 long balls against the Bulls on Wednesday.)\n\n\"We did every possible thing tonight. They scored against everything,\" Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. \"They hit 3s against everything. We switched. We got up on pick-and-rolls. We dropped on pick-and-rolls. We played zone. It didn't matter. Nothing we did made any impact on them whatsoever. We're playing abhorrent defense. Our defense is ridiculous.\"\n\n\"The ESPN crowd got a real treat tonight in terms of entertainment, but it was a pillow fight on defense,\" Carlisle said.\n\nMaterial from ESPN NBA reporters Tim MacMahon and Andrew Lopez, and ESPN Stats & Information was used in this report.", "meta_img": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F0213%2Fr814252_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9998323321342468}, "keywords": ["NBA", "Dallas Mavericks", "New Orleans Pelicans", "Kristaps Porzingis", "Luka Doncic", "Zion Williamson"], "summary": "Zion Williamson tallies an efficient 36 points for his career high , but Luka Doncic upstages him with a career - high 46 of his own in the Mavericks ' win over the Pelicans (. \n\n It was the 13th straight 25 - point game for Doncic , the third - longest streak by a player at age 21 or younger in NBA history."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "27629f94-82f8-4dba-9a8f-34bcafaa0df2", "source": "espn", "data": {"title": "Top 100 MLB prospects for 2021: The best No. 1 since Mike Trout and Bryce Harper", "link": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/insider/story/_/id/30833166/kiley-mcdaniel-top-100-mlb-prospects-2021", "description": "Here's how baseball's stars of tomorrow stack up as the sport returns to a full season.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 07:32:02 EST", "body": "Kiley McDaniel breaks down the Rays' farm system and how they consistently keep it at the top.

Watt after announcing his release from the Texans. (1:41)\n\nFor fans of Houston teams, the last 12 months has felt like one goodbye after another. With the Houston Texans agreeing to release J.J. Watt, one of the city's most beloved players is now gone.\n\nWatt, a three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year, will now move to another team after 10 years playing for the Texans in which he produced 101 sacks.\n\n\"I'm excited and looking forward to a new opportunity, and I've been working extremely hard,\" Watt said Friday. \"But at the same time, it is always tough to move on.\"\n\nWatt now joins an extensive and star-studded list of players to leave Houston teams in the last year.\n\nWR DeAndre Hopkins\n\nWhen: March 2020\n\nWhere: Traded to the Arizona Cardinals with a fourth-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft for running back David Johnson and two draft picks.\n\nWhat happened: Hopkins had 54 touchdowns in seven seasons in Houston. He was QB Deshaun Watson's top target and one of the best young receivers in the league. In grading the trade at the time, Bill Barnwell called it \"a jaw-dropping, mind-bending, inexplicable trade for [Bill] O'Brien, whose bizarre run as Texans general manager is going to be the subject of a 30 for 30 documentary one day.\" In his first season in Arizona, Hopkins became the go-to receiver for Cardinals QB Kyler Murray. Hopkins caught 115 passes for 1,407 yards and six scores in 2020.\n\nPG Russell Westbrook\n\nWhen: December 2020\n\nWhere: Westbrook was traded from the Houston Rockets to the Washington Wizards for John Wall and a lottery-protected 2023 first-round draft pick.\n\nWhat happened: Westbrook's stop in Houston was brief, but in one season with the Rockets, he averaged 27.2 points per game. The Rockets had another early exit from the NBA playoffs in 2020, and, according to ESPN's Tim MacMahon, Westbrook was frustrated with the style of play and lack of discipline of then-teammate James Harden. So far this season, Westbrook is averaging 19.7 points per game and the Wizards are 6-16.\n\nSG James Harden\n\nWhen: January 2021\n\nWhere: Harden was traded from the Rockets to the Brooklyn Nets in a four-team deal.\n\nWhat happened: Harden's eight seasons in Houston made him a legitimate superstar. He was a three-time scoring champion and the 2018 MVP. But the Rockets never reached the NBA Finals with Harden, despite his scoring prowess. By the start of this season, Houston had lost its coach and GM and Harden had demanded a trade. He showed up late to training camp and reportedly butted heads with Westbrook. \"I don't blame James. I blame the organization,\" a former Rockets assistant told MacMahon. \"It's not his fault. He did what they allowed him to do.\" In mid-January, Harden got his wish. He logged a triple-double in his Nets debut. With equally talented stars around him in Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant, Harden is averaging 23.9 points per game and 11 assists. The assist numbers are nearly five per game higher than his career average.\n\nWhen: January 2021\n\nWhere: A week after Harden's departure, Springer left the Houston Astros and signed a six-year, $150 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nWhat happened: Springer was a centerpiece of the Astros' recent dominance. He hit 174 home runs in seven seasons in Houston. He appeared in two World Series, winning in 2017 and being named series MVP. Springer was behind only Mike Trout in wins above replacement in two of the past three seasons. In Toronto, he will be another big bat in a lineup with Bo Bichette, Cavan Biggio and Vladimir Guerrero Jr.", "meta_img": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F0209%2Fr325866_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.7446513772010803}, "keywords": ["daily", "culture", "NFL", "NBA", "MLB", "Houston Rockets", "Houston Astros", "Houston Texans", "J.J.

I loved the goat. I miss that goat.\n\nRIP \"the goat.\" Long live \"the GOAT.\"\n\nThe second-worst thing about the GOAT debate is that it's apparently now over, at least in the minds of many fans and pundits after Tom Brady won Super Bowl LV (thanks to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' defense). Some are calling him the greatest athlete in sports, which is frankly an impossibility due to the existence of Serena Williams.\n\nThere is a difference between the GOAT of team sports and what Muhammad Ali, Serena, Tiger Woods, Michael Phelps and others have accomplished in their respective sports. It's not to say one feat is more impressive than the other. It's just to note the difference between the singular icon and the focal point of a collective.\n\nMany are instead saying that Brady is the GOAT of team sports, which also doesn't work, because Wayne Gretzky is the GOAT of team sports, full stop.\n\nRegular readers of this space know that I'm not some huge Great One fan. I think Mario Lemieux is the greatest hockey force ever unleashed on this planet. But if the task is to match Brady stat-for-stat and accolade-for-accolade, then we need Gretzky in this fight.\n\nThe great Jenny Vrentas of Sports Illustrated spoke with Gretzky about Brady recently, and asked him point-blank: Would you say he's the greatest athlete in any team sport?\n\n\"Well, listen, what makes sports so great, is we all sit and debate who the greatest teams were or who the greatest player was or who is the best quarterback is or who is the greatest athlete. I don't know a lot about football, I never played it, but it'd be hard-pressed for somebody to tell me that somebody else was better than he was,\" said Gretzky.\n\nParaphrased translation: 'Yes, he is the greatest ... at football, I guess.'\n\nWhen you lay out the case, Brady is the football GOAT, but Wayne Gretzky is the GOAT of team sports.

Create or join a league today >>\n\nBut for a minute, let's quickly revisit what I discussed last week in this space: Fantasy points banking on the schedule. Things have changed since last week. Hopefully this will be the last time a slew of postponements makes it worthwhile to check on the schedule in detail.\n\nAs of Monday, Feb. 15, the New Jersey Devils will have 47 games remaining. The range on the other end is the Vancouver Canucks, who will have 38 games remaining. Aside from the Devils, other potential teams whose players will have banked points would include the Buffalo Sabres with 46 games left, the Minnesota Wild with 45 games left and the Carolina Hurricanes, Colorado Avalanche, Dallas Stars, New York Rangers and Florida Panthers with 44 games.\n\nThe teams not mentioned all range from 40 to 43 games.\n\nI will also say that the general discrepancy still isn't enough to sway me to take action on the schedule via trade. Things change, players' paces will improve or fall off, and injuries will happen.\n\nCould you say that Nicklas Backstrom's 2.8 fantasy points per game (FPPG) over the Capitals remaining 43 games would be more valuable than Leon Draisaitl's 3.0 FPPG over the Oilers remaining 40 games? That would be accurate, yes.\n\nBut is it reasonable to think Backstrom will keep up that pace compared to Draisaitl? Would you want to make that trade for Backstrom? I would argue no.\n\nIf you happen to be dealing in the extremes, then an argument could be made. Would I consider trying to offload Elias Pettersson (38 games left), who is struggling anyway, for Jack Hughes (47 games left)? Absolutely -- especially if my fantasy team was struggling. Even if Pettersson regains his form, the extra nine games will go a long way to helping offset any difference.\n\nFantasy Forecaster: Feb. 15 to Feb. 21\n\nThe four teams heading to Lake Tahoe will have only two games on the schedule this week, as well as the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nTeam Gms Ratings Mon\n\n2/15 Tue\n\n2/16 Wed\n\n2/17 Thu\n\n2/18 Fri\n\n2/19 Sat\n\n2/20 Sun\n\n2/21 3 1 10 @SJ 3 8 OFF OFF MIN 1 10 OFF MIN 1 10 OFF 3 6 6 STL 7 8 OFF OFF LA 5 7 OFF LA 5 7 OFF 2 5 5 OFF OFF OFF NJ 8 10 OFF OFF PHI 9 8 4 7 8 NYI 5 7 NYI 5 7 OFF @WSH 8 3 OFF @NJ 8 8 OFF 4 7 9 @VAN 7 8 OFF VAN 7 8 OFF EDM 7 5 @EDM 7 5 OFF 4 7 5 CLS 8 7 OFF FLA 7 4 OFF CHI 7 4 CHI 7 4 OFF 4 8 9 @DET 10 9 OFF @DET 10 9 OFF @CAR 7 4 @CAR 7 4 OFF 2 4 5 OFF @VGS 6 9 OFF OFF OFF VGS 6 9 OFF 3 6 4 @CAR 4 2 OFF OFF NSH 8 6 OFF NSH 8 6 OFF 4 8 8 NSH 10 8 NSH 10 8 OFF TB 5 4 OFF TB 5 4 OFF 4 1 2 CHI 1 2 OFF CHI 1 2 OFF FLA 1 1 FLA 1 1 OFF 4 6 4 WPG 6 3 OFF WPG 6 3 OFF @CGY 6 4 CGY 6 4 OFF 4 8 9 @TB 6 4 OFF @CAR 8 4 OFF @DET 10 10 @DET 10 10 OFF 3 4 6 OFF MIN 4 9 OFF @ARI 4 6 OFF @ARI 4 6 OFF 3 2 9 OFF @LA 3 7 OFF @ANA 1 10 OFF @ANA 1 10 OFF 2 5 4 OFF OFF OFF OFF OFF TOR 6 3 @OTT 10 8 4 4 3 @DAL 2 1 @DAL 2 1 OFF @CLS 4 4 OFF @CLS 4 4 OFF 3 2 4 OFF @NYR 2 7 OFF @BOS 1 2 OFF BUF 3 3 OFF 4 6 8 @BUF 3 5 @BUF 3 5 OFF @PIT 6 8 OFF @PIT 6 8 OFF 4 6 6 OFF NJ 4 9 OFF @PHI 5 6 OFF @WSH 4 3 @WSH 4 3 4 2 1 @TOR 2 1 OFF @TOR 2 1 @TOR 2 1 OFF OFF MTL 2 1 2 3 3 OFF OFF OFF NYR 5 6 OFF OFF @BOS 3 2 3 3 3 OFF WSH 5 1 OFF NYI 3 5 OFF NYI 3 5 OFF 3 4 6 ANA 2 8 OFF OFF @STL 6 6 OFF @STL 6 6 OFF 3 5 4 @ARI 3 4 OFF OFF SJ 6 5 OFF SJ 6 5 OFF 3 6 5 FLA 8 5 OFF OFF @DAL 7 5 OFF @DAL 7 5 OFF 4 10 10 OTT 10 8 OFF OTT 10 8 OTT 10 8 OFF @MTL 8 5 OFF 4 4 4 CGY 3 4 OFF @CGY 3 4 OFF WPG 4 3 OFF WPG 4 3 2 1 3 OFF COL 2 5 OFF OFF OFF @COL 2 5 OFF 4 8 7 OFF @PIT 10 6 OFF BUF 9 3 OFF NYR 8 7 NYR 8 7 4 8 7 @EDM 8 5 OFF @EDM 8 5 OFF @VAN 9 7 OFF @VAN 9 7\n\nFor those new to the forecaster chart, here are some explanations: \"O\" (offense), which is on the left for each game, and \"D\" (defense), on the right, matchup ratings are based upon a scale from 1 (poor matchup) to 10 (excellent matchup) and are calculated using a formula that evaluates the team's season-to-date statistics, their performance in home/road games depending on where the game is to be played, as well as their opponents' numbers in those categories.

OK, fine, that's not super helpful when a team is so top heavy that its players are either rostered in 100 percent of leagues or fewer than 20 percent. But, there is a particular opportunity at the moment ahead of the Leafs four-game week that includes three home dates with the Senators: With Wayne Simmonds on the long-term IR with a broken wrist, Ilya Mikheyev is locked in as the new winger for John Tavares and William Nylander. He has a point in each of his two games in the role so far.\n\nThe NHL on ESPN+ Catch NHL games streaming live every night (and on replay) this season on ESPN+. Click here for the upcoming schedule and to learn how to subscribe.\n\nCarolina Hurricanes: A four-game week and plenty of players available to help in fantasy. Jordan Staal's production this season has been among the league's elite. His 9.29 fantasy points per 60 minutes (FPP60) is top 12 in the NHL and, with 17:29 average ice time, his FPPG is still top 20. Vincent Trocheck, who will be less available than Staal, has posted similar metrics. Both players have been elevated to the top power-play unit at the moment.\n\nWinnipeg Jets: The Jets are clearly still tinkering with their newfound bounty of centers. Pierre-Luc Dubois has played two games with the club and the look has been different both times. That said, one consistent in both games has been the line of Mark Scheifele, Nikolaj Ehlers and Andrew Copp. The Jets seem determined to keep Copp in the top six, so it may be time to stop sleeping on him as an option. This is a good schedule for scoring next week with two games against the Oilers and two against the Canucks.\n\nPlayer notes\n\nMax Comtois, W, Anaheim Ducks: I've mentioned already this season that I think I'm overcompensating for my mistake in pushing Comtois too hard a year early. But it's hard to ignore that he's stepped up as the leader for the Ducks struggling offense. He has twice as many goals as anyone else on the team so far, has decent enough counting stats for a forward (shots, hits, blocked shots) and, if he continues to show promise, will come into more power-play time eventually.\n\nplay 0:20 Comtois provides all the offense in Ducks' win Max Comtois scores the game's only goal as Anaheim defeats Vegas 1-0.\n\nOliver Ekman-Larsson, D, Arizona Coyotes: Expected back from injury Friday, he is available in about a quarter of ESPN.com leagues. Jakob Chychrun has elevated his game in OEL's absence, but Ekman-Larsson will still be the go-to option for the Coyotes on the man advantage. He should be rostered universally.\n\nCam Atkinson, W, Columbus Blue Jackets: There's the line combination we've been looking for. Atkinson played with the former Jets for the past three games and the trio led the Blue Jackets in ice time on Thursday. Atkinson's four points against the Blackhawks didn't all come with Jack Roslovic and Patrik Laine (in fact, only one did), but it should be a confidence-boosting outing for the relatively new trio. If you are into this idea too, also consider Roslovic, who has five points in the three games they've been together.\n\nNicolas Beaudin, D, Chicago Blackhawks: Not an early lock for the Hawks lineup so far this season, Beaudin has stepped into the secondary power-play quarterback role in recent games. He took on the first unit on Thursday and picked up a couple points. Duncan Keith and Adam Boqvist haven't cemented their role there, so this is worth monitoring.", "meta_img": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F0212%2Fr814046_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9984897375106812}, "keywords": ["Fantasy", "NHL", "news - fantasy", "news - fantasy hockey", "news - nhl"], "summary": "The Colorado Avalanche have been out of action since Feb. 2 due to postponements. \n\n As of Monday , Feb. 15 , the New Jersey Devils will have 47 games remaining."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "3c0bde6b-2bba-490f-ab92-25d14e6f362b", "source": "espn", "data": {"title": "Waiver watch: Jesse Puljujarvi, Joe Thornton among top players to add", "link": "https://www.espn.com/fantasy/hockey/story/_/id/30862997/fantasy-hockey-waiver-watch-jesse-puljujarvi-joe-thornton-top-players-add", "description": "Victoria Matiash goes around the NHL and identifies the widely available fantasy options who are worth adding to your roster.", "published": "Sat, 13 Feb 2021 08:47:28 EST", "body": "Every week, we'll mine the waiver wire for lesser-rostered assets to help your squad, whether you favor dynasty or the redraft format, and we'll also toss in some tips for DFS players out there. Finally, we will look at some former go-to fantasy assets who may be overvalued -- in the short- or long-term -- for one reason or another.\n\nUpdate (Monday, 12pm ET) on this week's game postponements in accordance with the NHL's COVID-19 protocol: The New Jersey Devils, Buffalo Sabres, and Pittsburgh Penguins are off until Thursday, at the earliest. The Minnesota Wild are also scheduled to resume play Thursday, but that could change in light of additional players joining the league's protocol list. The Colorado Avalanche are inactive until Sunday, Feb. 14. The Arizona Coyotes play the Blues Monday, but then sit idle until Saturday.\n\nForwards\n\nDavid Krejci, C, Boston Bruins (34.0%): The veteran forward should be rostered in all but the shallowest of leagues that value assists equally to goals. Centering a second scoring line with Nick Ritchie, Krejci has nine helpers to show for 11 contests, including five with the extra skater. Perennially underrated, the 34-year-old never gets the fantasy love he deserves -- at least never to open a season. He earned 73 points in 81 games only two years ago, including 20 goals. Pick him up before he starts potting them in the net too.\n\nJesse Puljujarvi, RW, Edmonton Oilers (37.8%): Only four weeks into the season and Puljujarvi has already featured a few times in ESPN's fantasy department space. The once-again Oiler looks great. He's playing on a top line with Connor McDavid. He has three goals in two recent games, two of which were set up by McDavid. The 22-year-old is making the most of his renewed NHL career. As long as he sticks alongside you-know-who, Puljujarvi boasts a lot of fantasy shine.\n\nJack Roslovic, C/RW, Columbus Blue Jackets (8.4%): The former Jet is having quite a time since being dealt to his hometown club. Collecting a goal and five assists in his past quartet of contests, Roslovic is now centering a Blue Jackets' top line with Patrick Laine and Cam Atkinson and competing on the club's top power play. The 24-year-old first-round draft pick (2015) should continue to pile up the points in filling those plum roles. He won't be widely available across the fantasy spectrum for long.\n\nJoe Thornton, C, Toronto Maple Leafs (7.6%): Not yet, but keep the veteran in mind ahead of next week. Recovering from a fractured rib, Thornton could be ready to go when the Leafs open a three-game home set against the Senators on Feb. 15. He returned to practice on Monday. Losing Wayne Simmonds for six weeks to a broken wrist, Toronto will certainly benefit from having Thornton back in action, particularly on the power play.\n\nPlay Fantasy Hockey for Free Join or create a league in the No. 1 Fantasy Hockey game, and play your way with custom scoring and lineup features. Create or join a league today >>\n\nScott Laughton, C, Philadelphia Flyers (7.5%): As illustrated by Laughton's first career hat-trick versus the Capitals on Sunday, the Flyers' third line provides more scoring pop than most other bottom-six units around the league. The 26-year-old has steadily improved upon his numbers over the past three years and should take another significant stride forward this season. So long as he sticks on a unit with current scoring engine James van Riemsdyk. Leading the Flyers in hits (30), Laughton merits extra consideration in deeper leagues that also reward physical play.\n\nSee also: Tim Stutzle, LW, Ottawa Senators; Dylan Strome, C, Chicago Blackhawks; Tyler Johnson, C/RW/LW, Tampa Bay Lightning\n\nDefenders\n\nPierre-Olivier Joseph, Pittsburgh Penguins (7.1%): Sleeper-city, but fantasy managers in need could do much worse than roll the dice on the 21-year-old rookie. Joseph scored his first NHL goal versus the Islanders over the weekend, bumping his points total to five in seven games. In light of Pittsburgh's banged-up blue line, the young skater has been recently assigned to heavy minutes on the team's top pair alongside Kris Letang and plugged onto the club's secondary power play. Don't forget, the Coyotes drafted Joseph 23rd overall only four years ago. Perhaps we shouldn't be that surprised by his impressive play to date.\n\nThe NHL on ESPN+ Catch NHL games streaming live every night (and on replay) this season on ESPN+. Click here for the upcoming schedule and to learn how to subscribe.\n\nSee also: Erik Gustafsson, Philadelphia Flyers\n\nGoaltenders\n\nJake Allen, Montreal Canadiens (26.7%): The Canadiens backup has played nearly as much as Carey Price these past two weeks and he's performed superbly. While there's no disputing who steers the goaltending ship in Montreal, Allen has been good-to-great -- actually better than Price -- whenever called upon this campaign. And unlike the club's franchise netminder, the best backup in the biz is widely available in ESPN fantasy leagues. He deserves a spot in any league that allows for daily lineup shuffling.\n\nMike Smith, Edmonton Oilers (4.4%): We'll soon find out how much blame for the Oilers' defensive struggles can be justifiably heaped on Mikko Koskinen. Activated off injured reserve, Smith is apparently jazzed to make his season debut against the Senators on Monday. The 38-year-old says he feels great physically and mentally. Again, we'll see. An inconsistent fantasy asset in years past, Smith has unarguably enjoyed stretches of dominant play, here and there. Fantasy managers with issues in net may want to at least gauge whether he's about to enjoy such a stretch now. Hopefully with improved defensive support out front.\n\nSee also: James Reimer, Carolina Hurricanes\n\nLowered expectations\n\nVitek Vanecek, Washington Capitals (54.1%): The Capitals' current starting netminder has allowed a total of 11 goals in three straight losses (.855 save percentage), culminating with getting the hook against the Flyers on Sunday. That isn't going to cut it for a team with its sights on the playoffs. Plus, Ilya Samsonov is back to working out after sitting three weeks in accordance with the league's COVID-19 protocol. Washington's true No. 1 should be back at it relatively soon.\n\nSee also: Timo Meier, RW/LW, San Jose Sharks", "meta_img": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F0208%2Fr812451_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9996480345726013}, "keywords": ["Fantasy", "NHL", "news - fantasy", "news - fantasy hockey", "Fantasy NHL"], "summary": "The Minnesota Wild are also scheduled to resume play Thursday , but that could change in light of additional players joining the league 's protocol list.

(Lamoureux-Davidson's twin, Monique Lamoureux-Morando, scored the tying goal in the third period.)\n\nThe game, against fierce rival Canada, was epic. Even celebrities such as Lil Wayne and Steph Curry tweeted about it. With 2.89 million viewers alone on NBC Sports Network, the game was the network's most-watched show ever in the 11 p.m.-2:15 a.m. ET time slot. Upon returning home, the Americans embarked on a media tour, hoping to inspire the next generation of girls to dream bigger in hockey.\n\nHere is an oral history on the significance of that moment.\n\nPeter Elander, former assistant coach at University of North Dakota: I first began working with the twins in the fall of 2010. They were pretty raw. Very high competitive level, and they played tough. Technically, they were not really that talented, but they are really good at working on the technical aspect.\n\nAngela Ruggiero, Hockey Hall of Famer, former U.S. women's national team player: Those two are my little sisters. I saw so much of myself in them in some ways. When they made that team, they expected to be on the power play. When Mark Johnson didn't put them out there, they were like pouting on the bench, furious. They were pissed they weren't playing. They didn't have a bad attitude, they were just young, and didn't know how to hide it. But I saw a desire to make an impact, right out the gate. They were never just content. They always wanted to be better.\n\nElander: At the end of their first year [at UND], they had to get ready to go to worlds, but our season was over. So we did a lot of individual skates at Ralph Engelstad Arena. We put out three, four tires and went from one goal to the other. We'd do tai chi speed first. Then we'd increase the speed. They were not good at it, honestly. They had to work for every bit of control they have.\n\nLamoureux-Davidson: Peter had names for everything. One was called Fly Fishing. Oops, I Did It Again. He named moves after players too; the [Erik] Karlsson, the [Matt] Duchene. Moves we did around tires probably thousands of times. I probably failed equally as many times as I perfected it.\n\nElander: Normally, when you coach players and they can't do things, they get tired, and they escape the hardship of trying. What the Lamoureuxes had in their mind was if they couldn't do anything, they wanted to show you that they could learn it.\n\nHilary Knight, Team USA forward: They're the do-or-die homies you want there. Once we got into a fight in Grand Forks, fittingly, against Canada and you couldn't think of a better teammate you'd want on the ice with you.\n\nAfter losing in overtime in the 2014 Olympic finals to rival Canada -- the Canadians' fourth straight Olympic gold -- the two sides met again in the 2018 finals in Pyeongchang.\n\nThe stakes were incredibly high as the U.S. women's team was looking for its first gold medal in 20 years. David G. Mcintyre/Zuma Press/Icon Sportswire\n\nJulie Foudy, former U.S. women's soccer captain and ESPN reporter at 2018 Olympics: Losing in 2014 was just crushing to that team. I really felt for them, I could see how much it affected them. I knew how badly they wanted to win, to get the opportunity again on that stage, but I didn't know if the Lamoureuxes would have the chance. ... The twins were such an important part of that team ... pushing for equality in their fight with USA Hockey [in 2017], making sure maternity leave was included in the contract. They wanted to leave the program in a better place than they found it.\n\nKnight: As teammates, they were just resilient. There was a point in time, and I don't even know if I should be sharing this, to be honest, but I didn't know if they would make the Olympic team in 2018. Their talents weren't being showcased the way we all saw them showcased, and obviously the way everyone in the world saw them showcased in 2018.\n\nCassie Campbell-Pascall, former Canadian women's hockey captain, CBC broadcaster: They weren't going to make the team that year, that was the sense that I was getting.\n\nElander: I think that was a tough year for them mentally, coachingwise. I don't think they got what they deserved early in the year.\n\nMaddie Rooney, Team USA goaltender: The gold-medal game, it was definitely back-and-forth the entire game. Obviously any time we play Canada, it's always intense and physical. But with an Olympic gold medal on the line, it was even more heightened than normal.\n\nCampbell-Pascall: The Lamoureuxes were the two best American players in that game -- and not just because they scored. They were all over the place, making things happen. You could tell, they were on a mission to will their team to win.\n\nMarie-Philip Poulin, Team Canada captain: When you step on the ice and you get to play against them, you can tell right away they want to win. They'll do anything in their power to do it. It's tough to play against them, but over the years there's been mutual respect. The one thing I value is how hard they compete.\n\nRooney: The Lamoureuxes are always physical. They were probably in the box that game -- they're always in the box -- but they came out, and they were the heroes of the game for us.\n\nWith less than seven minutes remaining in the game, Canada clung to a 2-1 lead. Lamoureux-Morando scored on a breakaway.\n\nHer sister's shootout goal would become the offensive moment of the game, but Lamoureux-Morando's goal on a breakaway was critical. Andrew Nelles/USA TODAY Sports\n\nPoulin: Of course I remember that next goal. I remember it well. Monique got a nice pass, we had a bad change, she went in on the breakaway.\n\nCampbell-Pascall: If it's on one of their sticks and they have so much time, it's going to be in the back of the net.\n\nPoulin: That was a key moment when they tied it up. And a tough moment for us, when we thought we had the momentum.\n\nCampbell-Pascall: From a Canadian perspective, it was just 12 seconds. A poor dump-in, a poor change, it was just a 12-second letdown, if you will.\n\nAfter a 20-minute four-on-four overtime, with both teams getting high-quality chances, the game went into the shootout.\n\nMaddie Rooney's save on the final shootout shot by Meghan Agosta of Canada clinched the gold for the United States. Srdjan Suki/EPA\n\nAJ Mleczko, former U.S. national team player, NBC Sports broadcaster: I was so nervous because of what had happened four years earlier. Both in Sochi in Pyeongchang, I felt like the U.S. was the stronger team. Because it was a tie game, then we went into overtime, then we get to penalties. I see Poulin come on the ice, and I'm like, you've got to be kidding me. Poulin is going to be the killer again.\n\nPoulin: We were all pretty stressed, when it comes down to a do-or-die situation like the shootout.\n\nFoudy: There was much talent on display.\n\nMleczko: It's not like the NHL, where they do shootouts all the time, where you have a memory bank of who is good, who has had success against whom. They didn't do shootouts on the international women's side regularly.\n\nLamoureux-Morando: The move that [Canadian] Melodie Daoust pulled off, I mean, that was ridiculous.\n\nMleczko: Daoust did the Forsberg! And Peter Forsberg was sitting two booths over from me. I was like, this is crazy. All of us in the broadcast booth looked over at him when he did it.\n\nLamoureux-Davidson: Everyone that had gone before me came right down the middle at a pretty similar pace, I think Amanda [Kessel] was the only one that really slowed it up. So I wanted to change up the pace; even though I came down the middle, I took a winding road to get there.\n\nKnight: You just knew Joc was going to do something crazy, because she always does something crazy in practice. We hadn't been practicing shootout all year, but we did practice the day before, ironically.\n\nIf you needed a better look at how DIRTY Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson's game winning goal was \ud83d\ude31 https://t.co/wkOWa0qwZl pic.twitter.com/7GRRCOkoNk \u2014 #TokyoOlympics (@NBCOlympics) February 22, 2018\n\nLamoureux-Morando: She had this look of confidence in her eyes. She wasn't smiling, but she wasn't frowning. There was just this stoic, confident look. She went and gave Maddie Rooney a pound before she approached the center of the ice.\n\nLamoureux-Davidson: All I was focused on was selling the first fake.\n\nT.J. Oshie, Washington Capitals forward, who scored on four of six opportunities in a 2014 Olympic shootout against Russia: She looked like she was in the same mindset that I was when I was shooting [in the 2014 Olympics]. Everything else is blocked out, and you're just going in, going to do your best move, and you're focused on scoring a goal. Everything else fades into the background. The last thing I was thinking about was everyone watching back home, or what stage I was on.\n\nKnight: That fake that she did to get Shannon [Szabados, Team Canada's goaltender] to bite, that was picturesque. On the bench, it was a combination of excitement, awe and like, oh my goodness, it's happening.\n\nCampbell-Pascall: I was like, holy smokes. The audacity -- in that pressure of a situation -- to pull off that move? I learned after that she does it all the time, so it was like no big deal. But at the moment, I remember thinking, holy smokes, nerves of steel. And to do it on Shannon Szabados, the best goalie in the world.\n\nLamoureux-Davidson: Then obviously I had a pretty good backhand fake, and it was a wide-open net.\n\nPoulin: You have to be pretty talented to do those moves, and obviously for her to pull it out in a gold-medal game, in an Olympic final, it's pretty amazing.\n\nElander: I don't know how some artists or singers or athletes can get everything in sync in that pressured moment. It's amazing to me.\n\nOshie: It was amazing. That would have worked on an NHL goalie, no question. Her fake and the sell of the backhand, then her patience going to the forehand, it was pretty perfect. That's not an elementary shootout move, and she pulled it off to perfection.\n\nLamoureux-Morando: The stakes were so high. Not every player wants to be in that pressure situation. But with her confidence, I knew she was going to score. But for her to pull off that move, pretty flawlessly? I mean, we're twins, so it kind of feels like I scored, too.\n\nElander: I was so proud because she did something that day that she couldn't do eight years before.\n\nMleczko: I can still picture her celebration perfectly. It must have been such a thrill but also such a relief. Because she's trying something a little out of the ordinary. If you try something like that and it doesn't work, it looks more foolish than if you don't try anything new and it doesn't work.\n\nKnight: You grow up and you want to be part of those big moments and you want to represent her country because that's the pinnacle in our sport. And then you win, and you understand how important it is to other people who are along the journey with you. So it just kind of came full circle in a Disney sort of way, that storybook ending that we've always been searching for for 20 years now.\n\nRuggiero: They didn't celebrate like they won the gold medal, which I liked. Because they knew they hadn't won. It was a big goal, but it wasn't over.\n\nKnight: On the bench, I think it was [Brianna] Decker, who said to Maddie: \"One more!\"\n\nRooney: At that moment, I was just feeding off the energy of the bench. I couldn't imagine what they were going through, because they couldn't control anything. It was literally down to just me.\n\nRuggiero: By the Rooney save, I lost my s---. Of course, I was standing next to the president of the Canadian Olympic committee. But I still cheered. I didn't care.\n\nThis win became a victory for more than Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson and her teammates. Ken Murray/Icon Sportswire\n\nPoulin: There's a lot of mixed feelings, obviously, for us. But that was a great game for women's hockey in general.\n\nRuggiero: In eight years as an IOC member, this is my favorite moment. I was supposed to give the medal out in Sochi, but I had to come back early because I was in business school at the time and my professor was going to kill me. But thank god, because then I was going to have to give Canada their gold medals. In overtime [in 2018], they needed me to walk somewhere to be in a prep area. So I watching f---ing overtime from a tiny screen. So I left. I was behind Maddie Rooney. If you look at the replay, you can see me pounding on the glass.\n\nKnight: We were all celebrating after the game with our friends and family and our coaching staff. And somebody came up to one of our coaches and was like, \"Aren't you glad you didn't cut the twins?\"\n\nLamoureux-Morando: What's so meaningful about how good our game was -- it wasn't just good for the women's game. It was a good hockey game to watch.\n\nLamoureux-Davidson: As some of our teammates like to say, America likes winners. We had two silver medals, but when we came home with a gold, it was a whirlwind. We were America's team. We were at multiple NHL venues, traveling across the country, hearing so many people tell us how they let their kids stay up late to watch, how they went into work the next day late because they stayed up to the middle of the night watching our game.\n\nLamoureux-Morando: There are going to be young girls who remember watching that game who are going to be inspired to play in the Olympics. One day, in 20 years or whatever it is, there are going to be girls on the Olympic team who remember watching that game. It's pretty special to think about.", "meta_img": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2018%2F0222%2Fr331630_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.999086856842041}, "keywords": ["Olympic Sports", "NHL", "NCAA Women's Hockey"], "summary": "Jocelyne Lamoureux - Davidson 's winning shootout goal in the 2018 Olympic women 's hockey gold - medal game -- using the move she and her coach dubbed Oops , I Did It Again , a nod to Britney Spears -- was one of the most iconic moments in U.S. women 's hockey history , helping the American women win their first Olympic gold in 20 years (.

Plus, stars of the week, top upcoming games and more.", "published": "Mon, 8 Feb 2021 06:53:07 EST", "body": "On Feb. 28, Maddie Rooney will play at Madison Square Garden as part of the Professional Women's Hockey Players Association Dream Gap Tour.\n\nFor the 23-year-old goalie, it's \"an incredible opportunity\" to play in New York City at the world's most famous arena. Unfortunately, her preparation for the game hasn't exactly been ideal. Since the pandemic wreaked havoc on our daily routines in March 2020, competitive action has been scarce. \"To be exact,\" Rooney says, \"since March 2020, I have played exactly seven periods of hockey. Those were at PWHPA scrimmages against local boys teams, high school teams and junior teams. Then at [national team] camp we played six games, but as a goalie I had to split that.\"\n\nCompare that to the season prior when, as a senior at Minnesota-Duluth, Rooney was typically playing two games per weekend. The women's hockey landscape presents an exaggerated case, but lack of proper ramp-up time for goalies is a theme we're seeing across hockey, including the NHL in the 2021 season.\n\nIt's one of the reasons that explains why through the first month of the season, the leaguewide save percentage has been hovering around .900; excluding the lockout-shortened seasons in 1995 and 2013, the last time a save percentage was below .900 for the month of October (typically the season's first month) was 2005-06, when it was .894 while coming out of a season-long lockout.\n\nA couple of stats help explain the slow goalie starts. Penalty kills are struggling (tracking for a league-wide worst first month total since 1985-86), and according to Evolving Hockey, shooting percentages are abnormally high (at around 8.5% at even strength, we're trending for the highest-single season rate since 2007-08). All of this comes after a significantly truncated training camp and the cancellation of all preseason games.\n\n\"The usual smoothness of getting into the game, just from my perspective watching the league, has been a little slower,\" says Jim Corsi, the longtime NHL goaltending coach who now oversees goaltending development for the Columbus Blue Jackets organization.\n\nIt's important to understand why live action is so critical to goalies as part of their training. \"Game timing is a very different thing than practice or shinny hockey,\" says Ryan Miller, the veteran Anaheim Ducks goaltender. \"In shinny hockey, guys are trying goofy plays, holding on to it, making extra passes. An NHL game tends to be more direct, more congested. Obviously there's great playmaking, but as a goaltender you have to stay inside of play, where you can reach some of those plays, make it challenging on a guy. You can't commit to the first situation so hard and give them something else.\"\n\nCorsi said the hardest part of the game to adjust to after long layoff periods are \"non-puck play.\"\n\n\"In a penalty kill for example, you're supposed to take a certain position if you're in the bottom of the circle and cut off a certain access portion of the net,\" Corsi says. \"If you're just 6 inches off, guys will put that in.\"\n\nIn explaining why New York Rangers goalie Igor Shesterkin was uncharacteristically struggling to begin the season, longtime NHL goalie and current NHL Network analyst Kevin Weekes found some flaws in his positioning. \"One thing that is different right now is he's allowing goals through his body,\" Weekes says. \"Like [opponents are] finding holes, which most goalies in the NHL don't do -- unless you're going through a rough patch. But everyday NHL goalies don't allow them very often. For that reason, he looks smaller in the net, even though he's not a small guy. I think it's a confidence thing.\n\n\"I know from putting myself in the spot in terms of positioning, and you know you're in the right spot, and somehow the puck can find a hole. If that happens once, you shrug it off. If it happens two, three times, you start second-guessing yourself, and the next thing you know you're misplaying pucks that would hit you routinely in your body.\"\n\nFor goalies on teams that didn't make the 2020 postseason -- like Ryan Miller of the Ducks -- they hadn't seen live game action in over 10 months. Debora Robinson/NHLI via Getty Images\n\nTo compensate for the lack of proper preparations, goalies have been scrambling for extra practice time through the pandemic, which proved difficult amid sweeping lockdowns. \"Some goalies can't find shooters because they are only allowed two people on the ice,\" Corsi says. \"If you get one goalie, one shooter, after 15 minutes, the shooter is drained. And I have to stay on the bench, because there's only two people allowed on the ice.\"\n\nCorsi has recommended some of his players to try to find outdoor ice. Recently, Corsi sent one of his pupils, a 17-year-old goalie, and his dad, to a local rink to practice. The police came by and shut them down. In that jurisdiction, wearing hockey equipment on the ice was banned, as a measure to prevent games.\n\nRooney lives in Minnesota where rinks were closed for a while during the pandemic; during the second half of the summer, fellow Team USA goalie Nicole Hensley flew out, and the two were able to split on-ice sessions with a goalie coach.\n\nNHL.TV is back for 2021!

Click here to learn more \u00bb\n\nBecause the Ducks were one of seven teams that didn't participate in the bubble, Miller last played an NHL game in March -- meaning his first game action this season came after a nearly 10 and a half-month layoff. The 40-year-old says he has tried \"to find game simulation in practice\" the best he can. \"We have such a limited amount of practice, so you're just trying to find situations and take advantage of,\" Miller says. \"Get on the ice early, be on the ice late. If the penalty killer or power play is doing something that would typically be kind of tedious, I stay around and take the reps.\"\n\nCorsi saw the pandemic as an opportunity for goalies to embrace more visualization work. This is something he has believed in for a while, and something he thinks \"should be a bigger part of what we've been doing.\"\n\nIn the Blue Jackets organization, they have challenged goaltenders to watch their own video of making a good or bad play and questioning, \"Can you do something better?\"\n\n\"A big part of it is to visualize, with imagery, and seeing yourself doing something; that can be really helpful,\" Corsi says. \" Psychologists have shown you can go through this visualization and see yourself succeed; that's really valuable. That can get you less body stress and more mentally prepared so when the situation occurs on the ice, your head has already seen it, so your body will react without having to process it.\"\n\nThat's something Rooney has begun to embrace, too. In 2018, she helped Team USA to its first Olympic gold medal in 20 years. It was disappointing that last year's Women's World Championships were canceled, and the women are hoping the event will be staged again in March 2021. However, as Rooney enters her prime athletic years, she is doing her best to continue her growth, fighting off having the pandemic halt all her momentum.\n\nShe follows a lot of goalie schools on Instagram, where she finds new speed and agility drills. Although Minnesota gyms have been closed for long stretches during the pandemic, Rooney's boyfriend owns a gym, so she's been able to get in a decent amount of strength, flexibility and rehab training.\n\n\"I also incorporate three hand-eye coordination drills, with three racquet balls, and I got through a set of drills that I acquired from other goalies over the years -- through what they've posted on social media,\" Rooney says. \"But a really big thing has been Vizual Edge, which is vision training. You wear these red and blue glasses, which mess up your typical vision, and it helps your tracking and overall vision.\"\n\nRooney has spent more time doing vision training than ever before. \"COVID definitely allowed me to branch out to resources available to me that I wouldn't have necessarily put time toward in the past,\" Rooney says. \"I'm interested to see if it will help with actual performance.\"\n\nRooney and the U.S. team defeated Canada to win the gold medals at the 2018 Olympics. EPA/SRDJAN SUKI\n\nIn this month's game at MSG -- which will pit Rooney's Minnesota PWHPA chapter against New Hampshire -- she knows it will take an adjustment to the game intensity. She's traveling to Florida before arriving in New York, where the PWHPA has arranged scrimmages against local boys teams (although Rooney is one of four PWHPA goalies in Florida for five scheduled games, so \"who knows how much game action I will actually get,\" she says.)\n\n\"The U.S. team, and the PWHPA rely on a lot of behind-the-net play from goalies, and playing the puck,\" Rooney says. \"I haven't been in those pressure situations with forecheckers on me in a long time. So making those quick decisions, that could be an area that might be challenging at first.\"\n\nShe's hoping the lag time won't be too bad.\n\n\"Honestly,\" she says. \"I'm really excited just to play in a competitive game again. It's going to feel so good to be out there.\"\n\nJump ahead:\n\nThree stars of the week\n\nWhat we liked this week\n\nWhat we didn't like\n\nBest games on tap\n\nSocial post of the week\n\nEmptying the notebook\n\n1. Miller, whose contract with the Ducks expired this past summer, wasn't sure what his future held when the 2019-20 season was paused in March, 2020. He decided to treat that pause as a recovery. \"I tracked down a bike,\" he said. \"I rode along the trails and boardwalks in the area; I tried to stay active, but I also really tried to do minimal stuff. I had gone through so many years of little things popping up, I wanted to see how I would recover. I stayed away from the ice for about five months, which is the longest I've gone since I learned how to skate.\"\n\n2. Miller ended up returning to the Ducks on a one-year, $1 million deal. I asked him if he had considered retirement. \"For sure,\" Miller said. \"The nature of what the league is like now, and that abrupt ending with no clear path forward, I didn't know how it would work out. I was trying to think about what else could happen. But after spending some time and reflecting, I wanted to give myself an opportunity to keep going if I could, and it worked out.\"\n\n3. The 2020-21 Ducks season is all about transitioning to the youth. And so fans are getting a little impatient that 2019 first-round pick Trevor Zegras, a hero for the gold-medal-winning U.S. at this winter's World Juniors Championships, hasn't gotten an NHL opportunity yet. The 19-year-old Zegras shined in his AHL debut this week, scoring a goal and two assists.\n\nGet Trevor Zegras into the NHL yesterday pic.twitter.com/sJjAhK0KrV \u2014 Dimitri Filipovic (@DimFilipovic) February 6, 2021\n\nMiller said Zegras came to Anaheim early this summer, and the two skated together for a few months. I asked Miller for his impression of the prized Ducks prospect. \"Talented player; easy-going demeanor where he wants to try anything, and he's not afraid to try anything,\" Miller said. \"I think early on, he was trying to size me up, try to figure out how to score at a different level. He was definitely creative, he did a few things that were unexpected. But it was also fun to show him some of the things that came a little easy are not easy.\"\n\n4. Auston Matthews has entered the MVP conversation. It's been a blazing hot start for the 23-year-old American, who has a league-high 10 goals in 11 games.\n\nA couple of interesting notes on Matthews entering this season. First, it really feels like he's on the cusp of superstardom (which probably would have been achieved in the U.S. by now, if he were playing on an American team). This year, Forbes has Matthews topping the list of highest-earning hockey players, with a salary of roughly $13 millions and endorsements of $3 million. I asked around to a couple of people in the know, and folks found this list generally accurate, with some slight inflation or estimations here or there. There's plenty of room for Matthews to grow; Alex Ovechkin leads all hockey players, per Forbes, with $5 million in endorsements, a number which still pales to athletes in the NBA and NFL. The key for Matthews in 2022 will be how much he wants to put himself out there, because the marketing potential is there.\n\nAnother thing on Matthews: People keep discussing how quick he looks on the ice. This offseason, Matthews began working with Chicago-based trainer Ian Mack, whose workouts are body-movement based and focus on muscle elasticity and getting the body to move in concert. Patrick Kane began working with Mack ahead of the 2018-19 season -- and went on to score a career-high 110 points. That was Kane's age-30 season, and he also averaged a career high in ice time per game (22:29).\n\n\"I'm playing a lot more, but I feel pretty fresh every night,\" Kane told me in 2019, about his work with Mack. \"I honestly think I feel better now than I did in my 20s. I really do.\"\n\nThree stars of the week\n\nDavid Pastrnak, RW, Boston Bruins\n\nPastrnak surprised many by tying Alex Ovechkin for the goal-scoring lead last season. But after hip surgery this offseason, some people were suggesting the 24-year-old was a prime candidate for regression in 2021. It doesn't look that way, after he scored five goals (including a hat trick against Philly) in just three games this week.\n\nJeff Petry, D, Montreal Canadiens\n\nHe's been an underrated breakout star of the Canadiens' sizzling hot start. Petry has six goals in 12 games this season -- including four goals in four games this week -- which is tied for the most by any defenseman through 12 games over the last 20 seasons. That's all the more impressive considering Petry didn't score his sixth goal until Game 41 of the 2019-20 campaign.\n\nPatrick Kane, RW, Chicago Blackhawks\n\nThe Blackhawks have been more competitive than expected, and boast three legitimate Calder Trophy candidates. But it's still Kane leading the way. He had a terrific week, scoring three goals and six assists for nine points in three games (while averaging nearly 23 minutes of ice time per game). That includes this assist on Sunday's overtime winner:\n\nPatrick Kane feeds Alex DeBrincat, who scores overtime winner. #Blackhawks pic.twitter.com/pb4GvufuLQ \u2014 Charlie Roumeliotis (@CRoumeliotis) February 7, 2021\n\nWhat we liked this week\n\n1. In his age-37 season, Duncan Keith is proving he's still elite in sass. After a two-game stretch this week where he recorded 10 shots (he typically averages only two per game) the defenseman told reporters: \"Getting the Corsi up so you guys think I'm good.\"\n\n2. It's been a strange start to the Pittsburgh Penguins' season, but a bright spot has been rookie defenseman Pierre-Oliver Joseph, who is making the most of a larger opportunity, thanks to a rash of blue-line injuries. Joseph -- whose older brother, Mathieu, is also getting a larger role in Tampa Bay this season -- has the highest plus-minus of any Penguins player this season (plus-5) and scored his first NHL goal on Saturday.\n\nTalk about ripping your first NHL goal.\n\n\n\nCongrats to you, Pierre-Olivier Joseph! pic.twitter.com/qenWMaIJ2q \u2014 NHL (@NHL) February 7, 2021\n\n\"He's been excellent,\" teammate Jake Guentzel said. \"It's been fun to watch, to be honest with you. His poise and how he handles himself -- how much confidence he has with the puck. That was a goal scorer's shot. ... To be part of a first goal is pretty cool.\"\n\n3. I honestly did not know Justin Faulk had this in him. The former Hurricanes defenseman is off to a great start in his second season St. Louis, looking more confident now that he has a better defined role.\n\nJustin Faulk embarrassing the Coyotes pic.twitter.com/Riwk3LmWwk \u2014 Brady Trettenero (@BradyTrett) February 3, 2021\n\n4. According to Elliotte Friedman of Sportsnet, the Senators are shopping veteran Derek Stepan. While he was brought over (as part of a salary dump trade in Arizona) to be a veteran presence for a rebuilding team, I have total respect for management for understanding what is truly in the player's best interest. Hopefully they can work something out.\n\nAs I noted on @TSNHockey Thursday, Derek Stepan was excited to get dealt to the #Sens , but the reality of not seeing his family until May 8 make the situation difficult. The couple has three children _ including a newborn _ and a visit would require 14-day quarantine. \u2014 Bruce Garrioch (@SunGarrioch) February 7, 2021\n\nWhat we didn't like this week\n\n1. The Buffalo Sabres were forced to temporarily shut down their season due to a cluster of COVID-19 cases and exposures -- including coach Ralph Krueger -- and they were quite upset about it. The issue is mostly with the NHL league office and the New Jersey Devils and surrounds the topic of transparency.\n\nAccording to Bob McKenzie, Sabres players contacted the NHLPA with concerns ahead of a game against the Devils on Jan. 30, where several New Jersey players had been put on the COVID-restricted list. Kyle Palmieri played on Jan. 30, then was added to the list the next day. It was an inflection point for the league, which has already seen Dallas and Carolina weather early-season outbreaks. Vegas has also had issues, while Minnesota and Colorado were forced to pause this week. The NFL's doctors reported they don't believe the coronavirus \"crossed the line of scrimmage\" this season, but it's unclear if that's the case in hockey -- which is inherently different because it is played indoors, with less ventilation. Detroit coach Jeff Blashill suggested this week he believes his team was infected by playing Carolina earlier this season.\n\nThe NHL on ESPN+ Catch NHL games streaming live every night (and on replay) this season on ESPN+. Click here for the upcoming schedule and to learn how to subscribe.\n\nThe NHL will continue to follow the advice of its medical advisors. Deputy commissioner Bill Daly told me this week the league plans to layer in more rapid testing \"as we go forward,\" which will help with the game-day lag we've been seeing in the PCR testing that manifested with the Devils-Sabres fiasco. The NHL and NHLPA have been working on securing more rapid tests -- with the understanding that even though the results are available in 15 minutes, which is great, there is a higher probability for false positives.\n\nI've been told that several teams have had talks with their players to please continue to exercise caution. Even if bars or indoor dining are open in a team's home market, players are being advised to stay away, as well as to continue to limit social interactions. We'll see how this all shakes out.\n\nThe league has been committed to being adaptable. As many front office folks have mentioned over the past few days, pay more attention to team's points percentage, as well as teams in the same division completing around the same number of games, with the understanding that maybe not everyone is going to be able to complete the full 56.\n\n2. This is a sad, sad stat:\n\nIt's been 464 days since a goaltender other than Jonathan Bernier won a game for the Detroit Red Wings and I'm honestly afraid that it may never happen again \u2014 Prashanth Iyer (@iyer_prashanth) February 3, 2021\n\n3. As Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl go, so do the Oilers. While it's been incredibly fun to see them dominate (McDavid has two or more points in seven straight games) it's concerning how much the Oilers rely upon them. For example, the duo played the final 5:45 of Saturday night's game against Calgary. Yes, there were some stoppages baked in there. But 5:45! That's Alex-Kovalev-five-minute-shift vibes.

Marco Luzzani/Getty Images\n\nIf you've spent more than 15 minutes on the internet in your lifetime, you've probably come across an age-old sporting argument about \"clutch.\" Who is \"clutch,\" and who is a \"choker?\" Does \"clutch\" exist, or is it just randomness that we forcibly burden with a pleasing narrative?\n\nMy personal opinions were well-enunciated by Peter Keating in ESPN The Magazine's 2014 analytics issue: \"Athletes aren't clutch because they raise their level of play in important situations; that's not a real, sustainable skill. Instead, these athletes are clutch because they don't choke as much relative to their peers.\" That point makes sense to me: some people panic under pressure, and some don't.\n\n- Stream ESPN FC Daily on ESPN+ (U.S. only)\n\n- ESPN+ viewer's guide: Bundesliga, Serie A, MLS, FA Cup and more\n\nI also know that determining who is officially clutch is a fool's errand because of the aforementioned randomness and generally small sample. That said, coming up big in key moments is something to be celebrated, whether it's sustainable or not. Again, take it from Keating: \"Respect clutch achievement, even if it's not predictable. Don't be killjoys.\" So whether they're clutch, or whether they've just made timely contributions, let's celebrate some soccer players who have done great things in key moments.\n\nWhich soccer players have seen the most clutch play/timely production over the years? To begin to answer that question, let's lay out who has been the most productive, period.\n\nplay 1:10 Europe's most clutch goal scorers Robert Lewandowski, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are masters of coming through in big moments.\n\nI created a starting sample of players by looking at the past 10 years of play in Europe's Big Five leagues (English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, Italian Serie A, German Bundesliga, French Ligue 1) and UEFA's club competitions, the Champions League and Europa League. It's not perfect. Guys who were great right before February 2011 (when the sample begins) but began aging out pretty quickly aren't going to have much of a track record. Nor will players who did great things in another league before joining the big leagues. I've left out the forever-small sample of international play as well, but this data will still tell us a story.\n\nIn this 10-year sample, 127 players have produced at least 100 overall goals and assists, from Dele Alli and James Milner (exactly 100 each) to Luis Suarez (367), Robert Lewandowski (393), Cristiano Ronaldo (554) and Leo Messi (593).\n\nMessi, Ronaldo, Lewandowski and most of the other big-name scorers: clutch\n\nAmong these 127 players, 12 have also produced at least 15 goals and assists in what I'll define as \"close-and-late\" situations: moments in the 80th minute or later in which either (A) the game is tied or (B) their team is behind in what eventually becomes a draw or win.\n\nThe 12 players in question:\n\nNote: clubs listed are the players' clubs as of 2021\n\n1. Lionel Messi, Barcelona: 25 (16 goals, 9 assists)\n\n2. Cristiano Ronaldo, Juventus: 24 (22, 2)\n\n3. Romelu Lukaku, Inter Milan: 21 (17, 4)\n\n4. Edinson Cavani, Man United: 20 (18, 2)\n\n5. Mario Balotelli, Monza: 18 (17, 1)\n\n6. Ciro Immobile, Lazio: 17 (15, 2)\n\n7. Robert Lewandowski, Bayern Munich: 16 (15, 1)\n\n8. Luis Suarez, Atletico Madrid: 16 (12, 4)\n\n9. Olivier Giroud, Chelsea: 16 (13, 3)\n\n10. Sergio Aguero, Manchester City: 15 (13, 2)\n\n11. Harry Kane, Tottenham: 15 (11, 4)\n\n12. Edin Dzeko, AS Roma: 15 (10, 5)\n\nNow, a lot of these players simply replicated their typical production rates in key moments. Messi, Ronaldo, Lewandowski, Suarez & Co. topped this list just like they top the overall production lists, though clutch production represents only about 4% of their total G+As. They mostly produced similar shot-per-minute and xG-per-shot averages, though if you're looking for standouts, Lewandowski's and Cavani's xG-per-shot averages jump from 0.20 overall to 0.24 in these close-and-late situations. It's a slight, but noticeable, difference.\n\nBalotelli and Lukaku: extra clutch\n\nSomeone like Balotelli is particularly interesting in our study. Long regarded as one of the better penalty-takers in the world, he went 9-for-9 on pens in these close-and-late situations; if we're looking for the most directly clutch situations in this sport, taking a penalty late in a game, with points on the line, ranks really high. Not only that, but 15% of his overall production -- 18 of his 119 goals and assists -- came in these situations, including his only assist of the 2011-12 season, and one of the most famous assists of all time.\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\n\nBalotelli's quirks (shall we say) have contributed to him having a bit of a journeyman's career: in the past decade, he has played for Manchester City, AC Milan, Liverpool, Milan again, Nice, Marseille, Brescia and, most recently, Monza in Serie B (Italy's second division). But if you needed a late magic act, he was one of the players most likely to deliver; after all, while he scored only four goals for Liverpool, three broke ties after the 80th minute.\n\nLukaku stands out as well. Of the most productive players in the sample -- the 27 with at least 200 combined goals and assists -- his close-and-late production represents the highest percentage of overall production: 9.3%.\n\nGranted, while the top overall scorers have consistently played for elite teams -- Messi with Barca, Ronaldo with Real Madrid and Juventus, Lewandowski mostly with Bayern -- Lukaku mainly has been on merely very good teams (Manchester United, Inter Milan) and therefore has played in a higher percentage of close games. But he has made the most of it.\n\nNils Petersen: underrated clutch\n\nWho else has seen a particularly healthy percentage of their production in close-and-late situations?\n\nHighest percentage of production coming in clutch situations:\n\nNote: clubs listed are the players' clubs as of 2021\n\n1. Mario Balotelli, Monza (15.7% of all goals and assists)\n\n2. Nils Petersen, SC Freiburg: 13.7% (14 of 102)\n\n3. Dani Parejo, Villarreal CF: 9.6% (11 of 115)\n\n4. Robin van Persie (retired): 9.5% (12 of 126)\n\n5. Roberto Soldado, Granada CF: 9.4% (13 of 138)\n\n6. Jimmy Briand, Bordeaux: 9.4% (11 of 117)\n\n7. Romelu Lukaku, Inter Milan: 9.3% (21 of 225)\n\n8. Willian, Arsenal: 9.2% (10 of 109)\n\n9. Iago Aspas, Celta Vigo: 9.0% (14 of 156)\n\n10. Alvaro Morata, Juventus: 8.5% (12 of 141)\n\nPetersen, 32, briefly signed with Bayern Munich in 2011, but he has spent most of this 10-year sample playing with Werder Bremen and SC Freiburg; he has had plenty of \"trailing late and team is desperate\" experience, but no one can say he hasn't come through, often via headers.\n\nAlvaro Morata: ultraclutch super-sub\n\nRonaldo, left, represents well in the data as you'd expect, but Morata, right, stands out for being the best super- sub of the modern era. Mattia Ozbot/Soccrates/Getty Images\n\nIf you watched the two-episode second season of Amazon's \"Take Us Home: Leeds United\" series, which provides a brief run-through of their long-awaited promotion push in 2019-20, you quickly understand the sentimental value of a \"super-sub,\" the guy you send to save the day or provide a jolt of energy when things aren't going quite right. (Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Man United's manager, made his name as a player by being this super-sub.)\n\nIn the home stretch of last season, Pablo Hernandez hopped off the bench and scored in back-to-back matches -- he first had a goal and an assist in an easy win over Stoke, then scored the vital go-ahead goal in the 89th minute of a scoreless tie against Swansea. He has 74 goals and assists with the club, but the Swansea goal assured the 35-year old former Valencia star legendary status in Leeds yore.\n\nSo looking more broadly, which subs have been the most super through the years? One guy in the sample towers over the others.\n\nGoals and assists for subs after the 80th minute, last 10 years:\n\nNote: clubs listed are the players' clubs as of 2021\n\n1. Alvaro Morata, Juventus: 32 (23 goals, 9 assists)\n\n2. Nils Petersen, SC Freiburg: 18 (13, 5)\n\n3. Olivier Giroud, Chelsea: 17 (15, 2)\n\n4. Kevin Gameiro, Valencia: 16 (12, 4)\n\n5. Edin Dzeko, AS Roma: 15 (10, 5)\n\n6. Paco Alcacer, Villarreal CF: 14 (12, 2)\n\n7. Javier Hernandez, LA Galaxy: 14 (11, 3)\n\n8. Luis Muriel, Atalanta: 14 (11, 3)\n\n9. Kylian Mbappe, Paris Saint-Germain: 14 (8, 6)\n\n10. Lucas Moura (Tottenham), Franck Ribery (Fiorentina) and Karim Benzema (Real Madrid): 13 each\n\nMorata's 141 combined goals and assists rank him 62nd overall in the 127-player sample. For context, that's eight behind Philippe Coutinho and 10 ahead of James Rodriguez. He has averaged between 0.6 and 1.1 goals and assists per 90 minutes for four different clubs and the Spanish national team. He also has spent a good portion of his career as his manager's second choice. He was a substitute in 58 of his 89 Real Madrid appearances, behind both Ronaldo and Benzema, and in two stints with current club Juventus he has been a sub in 50 of his 118 appearances.\n\nOh, but what a sub he has been. In substitute appearances between 2013-14 and 2016-17, he scored 20 times in just 1,250 minutes -- 11 times after the 80th minute. The 28-year old left Madrid in 2017 in search of more minutes and found 103 starts for Chelsea and Atletico Madrid before landing back with (and often behind) Ronaldo at Juventus. He has been good wherever he has played, but he's been great off the bench.\n\nGiroud has been too, and like Petersen, he does some of his best work with his head.\n\nThe new clutch: who is stepping up right now?\n\nNow, granted that Balotelli has been out of the spotlight for a while and Morata did most of his super-sub damage four to seven years ago, which names have emerged in the past couple of years when it comes to clutchitude?\n\nIf we look at the past three calendar years, here are your stars in the close-and-late department:\n\nMost combined goals and assists in clutch situations, past three years:\n\nNote: clubs listed are the players' clubs as of 2021\n\n1. Luis Suarez, Atletico Madrid: 10 goals and assists (10.0% of his total G+A)\n\n2. Ciro Immobile, Lazio: 9 (8.0%)\n\n3. Leo Messi, Barcelona: 9 (5.8%)\n\n4. Raul Jimenez, Wolves: 8 (13.6%)\n\n5. Iago Aspas, Celta Vigo: 8 (12.1%)\n\n6. Romelu Lukaku, Inter Milan: 8 (9.9%)\n\n7. Cristiano Ronaldo, Juventus: 8 (6.4%)\n\n8. Dani Parejo, Villarreal CF: 7 (15.9%)\n\n9. Harry Kane, Tottenham: 7 (7.4%)\n\n10. Robert Lewandowski, Bayern Munich: 7 (4.9%)\n\n11. Felipe Caicedo, Lazio: 6 (18.8%)\n\n12. Riccardo Orsolini, Bologna: 6 (17.6%)\n\n13. Jorge Molina, Granada CF: 6 (15.8%)\n\n14. Sergio Canales, Real Betis: 6 (14.6%)\n\n15. Andre Silva, Eintracht Frankfurt: 6 (12.2%)\n\n16. Andy Delort, Montpellier: 6 (11.8%)\n\n17. Lorenzo Insigne, Napoli: 6 (10.2%)\n\n18. Memphis Depay, Lyon: 6 (7.5%)\n\nAgain, most of the names at the top also are at the top of the overall production lists, but some interesting names have made the most of their clutch opportunities.\n\nTake Raul Jimenez, for instance. The Mexican international and former Benfica star has played for Wolves for most of this sample, and he has been quite the points saver: he has scored or assisted the go-ahead goal five times in the past year, and he has scored three times while behind in clutch situations, too. Clutch production has made up 14% of his overall production.\n\nYet that doesn't hold a candle to Felipe Caicedo. He has scored five clutch goals in three years, on only 10 shots. The Lazio star scored two late game winners in a month last winter (he also put away a win over Juventus on a counterattack), and he produced this wild winner in the 98th minute against Torino in November:\n\nHe also has scored five goals in the 80th minute or later as a sub since the start of 2019-20. Caicedo: clutch by any definition.\n\nPaco Alcacer and Christian Pulisic: the new clutch super-subs\n\nAnother recent super-sub also stands out.\n\nGoals and assists for subs after the 80th minute, past three years:\n\n1. Paco Alcacer, Villarreal CF: 11 (10 goals, 1 assist)\n\n2. Kylian Mbappe, PSG: 9 (7, 2)\n\n3. Angel Rodriguez, Getafe CF: 9 (7, 2)\n\n4. Gabriel Jesus, Man City: 9 (5, 4)\n\n5. Christian Pulisic, Chelsea: 9 (4, 5)\n\n6. Luis Muriel, Atalanta: 9 (8, 1)\n\nWhen Borussia Dortmund was making a full-season push at the Bundesliga title in 2018-19, Alcacer was their secret weapon. He scored eight times after the 80th minute; many were of the \"expands the lead from one to two\" variety, but he also scored two early-season winners. Now with Villarreal, he both broke a tie against Qarabag in the 84th minute in an October Europa League match, then sealed the game with a penalty in the 96th minute. If you need 20-25 minutes of shop-wrecking, few are more up to the task than Alcacer.\n\nMeanwhile, if you need a key passer off the bench in the closing minutes? Ask Alcacer's former Dortmund teammate, Captain America. Pulisic has battled both injuries and a crowded depth chart since moving to Chelsea, but he has been a lightning bolt off the bench at times. His assist to fellow sub Michy Batshuayi beat Ajax in the Champions League last year (and earned the nickname buy-in from his teammates), and his pinpoint pass set up the Marcus Alonso goal that put away Burnley recently.\n\nSo let's review. One big question you might have in reading this: Where are the superstars? Don't we consider Messi and his fellow GOAT generation to be clutch as well?\n\nMessi, Ronaldo, Lewandowski, Kane, Suarez and even guys like late-career star Ciro Immobile remain as excellent at the end of games as they are through the first 80 minutes. If you've got one of them at your disposal, you probably don't need a super-sub coming in for them at the end, nor do you need a clutch player to step up. But just as Francisco Trincao stole a game winner for Barca last weekend with an out-of-nowhere golazo, others can shine in a match's waning minutes, too. And whether it comes from a reserve of clutchness inside of you or sheer randomness, we can celebrate it all the same.", "meta_img": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F0211%2Fr813530_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9926042556762695}, "keywords": ["blog - espn fc united", "Romelu Lukaku", "\u00c1lvaro Morata", "Lionel Messi"], "summary": "play 1:10 Europe 's most clutch goal scorers Robert Lewandowski , Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are masters of coming through in big moments.

What started out as significant gains by players last February devolved into $150 million in concessions over the life of the deal last June. Neither side offered up a dollar figure in the latest CBA, but the league had been seeking upwards of $110m in concessions over the life of the deal from the players, while the MLSPA offered up $53m. To reach an agreement, the league had to use the threat of a lockout. Again.\n\nSo what did the league gain?\n\nThe biggest gain for MLS was their ability to extend the length of the CBA for an additional two years through the end of the 2027 season. This has the effect of doing two things. One, the extension delays the jump in compensation that typically comes with a new CBA. Second, such an extension provides the league with considerable distance from the 2026 World Cup -- co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico -- and takes away leverage from the MLSPA to negotiate improved terms in the run-up to the tournament and its immediate aftermath.\n\n- Stream ESPN FC Daily on ESPN+ (U.S. only)\n\n- ESPN+ viewer's guide: Bundesliga, Serie A, MLS, FA Cup and more\n\nMLS also succeeded in limiting the growth of the total roster spend (not including Designated Players) between the 2021 and 2022 seasons to $100,000, an increase of just 1.1%. This is on top of a freeze negotiated last June that froze the budget between 2020 and 2021. This will have a ripple effect into future seasons.\n\nThe share of incremental media revenues -- which will kick in when a new media rights deal is negotiated starting with the 2023 season -- was decreased from 25% to 12.5% in 2024.\n\nLastly, the dreaded force majeure clause remains in place, but with restrictions. It was this clause -- invoked because fans aren't likely to be allowed back into stadiums any time soon -- that allowed the league to reopen negotiations in late December and bring the MLSPA back to the bargaining table. With a deal now done, the clause cannot be invoked again until Dec. 1, 2021. This means that if MLS is still struggling financially into the summer, it can't come back to the MLSPA and try to reopen negotiations again. After Dec. 1, anything goes.\n\nplay 0:58 Twellman excited for MLS return Taylor Twellman breaks down the schedule ahead of the return of MLS for the 2021 season.\n\nWhat did the MLSPA gain?\n\nThis deal wasn't so much about what the MLSPA gained, but what it didn't lose. Preservation of present salaries has been a consistent goal of the MLSPA throughout the two most recent CBA negotiations. A source with knowledge of the situation said the union made direct payments to players last year in a bid to ease the sting of the 5% annualized cut in salaries, which resulted in the average annualized pay cut being reduced to 2.5%.\n\nWith that in mind, the union maintains that it had three goals entering these negotiations. The first was no cuts to 2021 salaries. The second was any current contracts for 2022 and beyond must be honored. (In other words, no coming back to the MLSPA and insisting on a salary cut, as was done in 2020.) The third was that minimum salaries and player bonuses would increase each year through 2027.\n\nAll of these goals were reached. According to details published by the league, the senior minimum will rise from $81,375 in 2021 to $125,875 in 2027, and the reserve minimum will rise from $63,547 in 2021 to $97,700 in 2027. Team win bonuses and contributions to players' 401(k) will remain as they were in the previous CBA. The MLSPA also secured accelerated growth rates in terms of spending on salary toward the back end of the deal, with the year-over-year growth rate increasing to 7.5% in 2026 and 10% in 2027.\n\nThe MLSPA also made modest gains in free agency for 2026 and 2027, with the eligibility requirements going from 24 years of age and five years in MLS to 24 and four. The MLSPA says this will have the effect of making a third of the entire MLS player pool eligible for free agency, compared to zero prior to 2015. Keep in mind, though, that there are limits to what players can make via free agency based on their previous salary.\n\nThe league will be restricted in how it can use the force majeure clause in the future. Scott Winters/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nSo who 'won' in all of this?\n\nAt first glance, you'd have to say the league and its owners, who used their leverage to good effect. They asked for concessions from the players and got what they wanted in terms of both the salary cap freeze and two-year extension. The force majeure remains in place as well, though with short-term limitations, and any \"givebacks\" are far down the road toward the end of the deal.\n\nWas it a total loss for the players? No. They're still getting paid their full salaries for 2021, and in some cases beyond. That was their stated aim all along. But the MLSPA was playing defense from the beginning, and with the threat of a lockout hanging over the union's collective head, the players had to give plenty. The growth of the spending on salaries is essentially frozen for two years, including the current season. The delay in the expiration of the CBA -- and the bump that usually comes with the next deal -- is considerable. The total player spend per team of $9.225m in 2020 represented a 13.1% increase from 2019, the last year of the 2015-19 CBA. Such a bump is now pushed out into the future.\n\nIf any group among the players \"won,\" it was those at the lower end of the pay scale. Unlike their higher-paid colleagues, there's no freeze for reserve minimum or senior minimum players, which means their pay will rise over each year of the deal. The \"losers\" are the low- to mid-range players who will be entering the league in the coming years, as well as existing MLS players who sign new contracts. There will simply be less money to go around than the union anticipated a year ago.\n\nThe big unknowns in all of this are what dollar amount the new media rights deal will fetch starting in 2023, along with the aforementioned loss of leverage around the 2026 World Cup. The MLSPA maintains that momentum from the World Cup isn't likely to go away by 2027, but the reality is that the percentage of the media rights deal the MLSPA would get went down again in 2024. And the timing of the CBA's expiration date means it will have less leverage than it had before.\n\nWhat was the broad reaction to the deal on both sides?\n\nThe league is no doubt pleased at the outcome. They got what they wanted, especially in terms of cost certainty surrounding the World Cup, without having to give much of anything away.\n\n\"I think the basic framework of this two-year extension, with the improvements that the players negotiated in free agency and some other things, increased economics and 2026 and 2027, but also not having pay reductions in in this year, I think it's a fair deal,\" said one source with knowledge of the situation. \"I think it's good for the league, because it provides some long-term stability, and I think that's good for everybody. It's great that we have this period of time for everybody to focus in on building league and making investments that are needed.\n\nThe general consensus among the players was summed up by one Western Conference player who said \"We did the best we could\" given the pandemic and threat of a lockout. The players didn't want to be in the position of renegotiating the deal, but that was the reality they faced.\n\nSan Jose Earthquakes forward Chris Wondolowski added, \"[It was a] mixed bag. I think this was probably the closest the two sides have come to some sort of work stoppage. That being said, the players finally had a major bargaining chip [in the World Cup]. I think it's going to hurt the younger player pool in a couple of years. All in all, I'm relieved there wasn't a stoppage.\"\n\nNot everyone was so positive. One MLS player agent who asked not to be identified called it \"unconscionable\" that the union agreed to a force majeure clause last June that made the union vulnerable to the league reopening negotiations.\n\nThe agent added that the MLSPA \"further failed its members by losing perhaps the 2020 CBA's most significant component -- minimizing the CBA length to five years to set up reassessment on a new media rights deal, expected full expansion and two years ahead of a hosted World Cup. MLS and its owners are laughing to the bank how the league turned a five-year CBA into an eight-year stranglehold that includes a domestic World Cup without any major concessions in return.\"\n\nSo has the union been weakened by three rounds of CBA talks? Certainly, the players are in a less advantageous position than they were a year ago. Based on the June CBA as well as in recent talks, the players have given up anywhere from $203m to $260m in concessions over the life of the deal. Not surprisingly, MLSPA executive director Bob Foose opted for a more positive viewpoint.\n\n\"By every measure I can think of -- player engagement and involvement, resources, staffing -- the PA is stronger now than it has ever been,\" said Foose. \"Our Bargaining Committee, which consisted of 13% of the player pool, was engaged, clear on their own priorities, clear on the priorities of their teammates, and prepared to make thoughtful decisions when they needed to be made. They stayed sharply focused on those priorities throughout. This pandemic has weakened all of us economically, but as an organization, I am extremely bullish about the PA's continued growth and development.\"\n\nThe league took some hits as well, but they are more easily absorbed given its sheer financial heft compared to the players.\n\nHow close were the players to getting locked out?\n\nA source with knowledge of the talks said the threat from the owners was serious. Given that the league extended its own deadline twice, it's easy to take such pronouncements with a grain of salt, but the players certainly took the league at its word.\n\nAsked at what point he was confident a deal would get done, Colorado Rapids goalkeeper and MLSPA executive board member Clint Irwin said, \"Really at no point. When management repeatedly threatens a lockout via press release, it's difficult to have confidence in any part of the negotiations that a deal can get done. That said, I'm proud of our player and executive leader for navigating this process, again, while subjected to management tactics that echoed those this past summer.\"\n\nWhat's to stop this from happening again?\n\nNothing, really. The players are safe from seeing the force majeure invoked again, but only until Dec. 1, 2021. At that point, the league is free to what it did last December, though if it comes to that, then that will be a reflection of how the pandemic is still dominating life in the U.S. a year on.\n\n\"I think the pandemic obviously continues to be a big concern for everyone,\" said Foose. \"But I believe the odds of there being a force majeure event in place in a year are extremely low.\"\n\nSo what's next?\n\nThe union will continue to do what it does: advocate for players away from the glare of a CBA negotiation. But Foose senses something has changed in the relationship between the league and the union. Neither Garber nor anyone else on the labor committee were involved in the face-to-face talks; it was all handled by MLS attorneys and outside counsel.\n\n\"It's not good,\" said Foose about the league/union relationship. \"I would characterize it as entirely transactional. To me, that's far from the ideal way to conduct those relations, so that's something that they're gonna have to make a decision on moving forward.\"\n\nIrwin added that the relationship between players and ownership is worse than it was last June, which was another time the owners threatened the players with a lockout.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be this way,\" he said. \"There are other ways for the league and its owners to approach these issues, issues that are challenging to both sides. We've seen collaboration in other North American sports leagues, between management and union, where a working relationship exists amid identical circumstances. We have a long way to go to get there now.\"\n\nThe reality however is that memories fade while players come and go. When Jan. 31, 2028 -- the revised CBA's expiration date -- rolls around, few of those involved in the just concluded talks will be around. And MLS will likely continue to have the upper hand in its relationship with its players.", "meta_img": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F0209%2Fr812472_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9961782097816467}, "keywords": ["Major League Soccer"], "summary": "The biggest gain for MLS was their ability to extend the length of the CBA for an additional two years through the end of the 2027 season.

It's an approach that, in the past six months alone, has seen the likes of Bryan Reynolds (FC Dallas to Roma), Mark McKenzie (Philadelphia Union to Genk), Brenden Aaronson (Philadelphia to FC Salzburg), and Daryl Dike (Orlando City to Barnsley), each make moves abroad before their 22nd birthdays.\n\nThe recent exodus continues an ever-growing trend for American stars, with the likes of Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tyler Adams and Giovani Reyna having all previously crossed the Atlantic as youngsters.\n\nJump to: A few minutes with Cannon | Stock watch: Brooks, Pulisic, Siebatcheu, De La Fuente\n\nAll of which makes the paths taken by Paul Arriola and Jordan Morris feel anachronistic by comparison. Both recently completed loan moves to English Championship high-flyers Swansea City -- and could line up against Manchester City this Wednesday in the FA Cup (12:30 p.m. ET, ESPN+) -- but did so at the relatively advanced age of 26. Not that it's too late by any means.\n\n\"My goal was always to grow as a player, and that continues to be my goal,\" said Arriola. \"How can I push myself? How can I take myself to the next level?\"\n\nGranted, each career carries with it its own momentum. For some, the path is clear early on and resembles a beautifully paved road. Others can get stuck in blind alleys or turn down opportunities to move abroad, the path not taken haunting them at the end of their playing days. There is also a school of thought that starting out abroad and then returning to MLS is akin to forever turning one's back on foreign opportunities. Yet that is what Arriola did, beginning his career with Liga MX side Club Tijuana, where he spent four years.\n\nWhile Arriola made himself useful for Xolos, he never quite rose to the ranks of being indispensable. So when D.C. United came calling in 2017 with a $3 million transfer fee, he jumped at the chance, eschewing other opportunities overseas, and became a consistent presence for both the Black-and-Red and the United States men's national team. All the while, the California native never closed the door on future opportunities abroad.\n\nCarabao Cup LIVE: Swansea City vs. Man City, 2/10, 12:30 p.m. ET\n\n\"My thoughts were I can use MLS as a trampoline bounce, and then go further if I was successful,\" he said. \"I found some stability [with DCU], and I was able to establish myself. I continued to want that same type of career where you're a constant impact player, you're always involved in games.\"\n\nplay 1:06 Jordan Morris' home debut for Swansea Swansea City loanee Jordan Morris comes on and gets an instant penalty shout for the Swans.\n\nAs much as it's become a cliche that there are myriad paths to a successful pro career, Morris seemed to violate even more tenets of how best to navigate that path. He turned down a homegrown deal with the Seattle Sounders when he was 18 in order to go the much-maligned college route and attend Stanford University. His reasoning was simple -- with the likes of Clint Dempsey, Obafemi Martins, and Eddie Johnson on the team's books, playing time would be hard to come by. Going to a high-level program like Stanford would still test him.\n\n\"Going [to Stanford], I felt that my path was just going to be: play however many years there, hopefully, try to win a national championship and then come back to the Sounders because European teams aren't scouting college kids,\" he said.\n\nA scrimmage against the U.S. men's national team ahead of the 2014 World Cup changed everything. Morris impressed then-U.S. manager Jurgen Klinsmann so much that he was called up to the senior team later that year, becoming the first college player in 15 years to play for the USMNT. Then in 2015, in his first international start, the forward scored in a friendly against rivals Mexico. When Morris decided to turn professional in early 2016 following his junior year at Stanford, he trained with and received an offer from Bundesliga side Werder Bremen. Seattle was also trying to land the forward, but it was clear what most observers thought he should do: Head to Germany. Morris disagreed, joining the hometown Sounders instead.\n\nJordan Morris turned down a move to Europe when he was 21 to stay and develop closer to home with the Seattle Sounders of MLS. Photo by Athena Pictures/Getty Images\n\n\"Going over to Bremen, I definitely felt that pressure, that people thought that was the best option for me,\" Morris said. \"But I knew myself. And I knew what I felt was going to be best for my career and where I felt I would develop the best and I felt that was going to be Seattle.\"\n\nThat decision was panned in some circles: then-U.S. international Jermaine Jones said at the time that Morris took \"the easy way.\" But Morris felt that being near home would help him adapt to the professional game, and time has shown the move clearly paid off with a pair of MLS Cups to his name. When Morris tore his ACL in 2018, being close to family aided his recovery. And like Arriola, Morris never felt like he was completely giving up on a European move.\n\n\"I felt confident that that option would be there,\" he said. \"But again, at the time, and even now, if I played my whole career in Seattle, I think I would have been really, really happy and fulfilled and felt that I developed really well as a player.\"\n\nAmericans in Europe ESPN highlights the biggest stories around United States stars plying their trade overseas, bringing inside information to their successes and struggles, sitting down with some of the national team's top players, and scouting the next generation of Americans breaking through across Europe.\n\nCould either player have developed quicker if they had pounced on overseas opportunities earlier in their careers? It's impossible to say. One or both might have seen their stock skyrocket, but plenty of American careers have dried up in Europe as well. They certainly head to Europe now as more established, mature players.\n\nTiming was a factor as well in terms of making a move now. Morris said he had been feeling the itch in recent years to test himself overseas. With MLS not scheduled to start until April 3, Arriola spoke of not wanting to wait a few months for his next competitive match, especially as he continues to return to full strength following an ACL injury of his own. With a busy international calendar ahead, testing themselves and staying sharp will be paramount. And now they'll have each other to lean on as well, on a club in the thick of the Premier League promotion race.\n\n\"Paul and I are really close, [and have been] for a while now with the national team,\" said Morris. \"He's one of my good friends, so it's pretty surreal actually, that we ended up in the in the same spot.\"\n\nEspecially given the paths they took.-- Jeff Carlisle\n\nA few minutes with ...

In fact, Wolfsburg have not conceded a goal in five consecutive games over all competitions, with Brooks playing every minute during that span. The 28-year-old was reportedly available for transfer last summer, sources tell ESPN, but it would seem Wolfsburg are quite happy that they have held onto the American.\n\nAccording to one German journalist, Brooks has formed an \"ideal partnership\" with newcomer Maxence Lacroix due to Brooks' experience and Lacroix's speed. If Brooks' can replicate his recent club form with the national team, it would be a huge boon for the USMNT, as inconsistency has defined his international career so far.\n\n- Stream ESPN FC Daily on ESPN+ (U.S. only)\n\n- ESPN+ viewer's guide: Bundesliga, Serie A, MLS, FA Cup and more\n\nChristian Pulisic, Chelsea - Trending down Trending down : Thomas Tuchel confirmed after Chelsea's win over Sheffield United on Sunday that Pulisic was omitted from the squad because of \"family issues,\" but the 22-year-old's involvement under the new Blues boss has been limited to 84 minutes in four games.\n\nSources tell ESPN's James Olley that the United States international's diminished game time could be explained by a couple of reasons: the club's medical staff are concerned that the United States international is at risk of suffering another hamstring injury, and Tuchel is keen to evaluate the squad at his disposal, already having a good understanding of what Pulisic offers after their time together at Borussia Dortmund.\n\nJordan Siebatcheu, Young Boys (on loan from Rennes) -- On the rise : If Siebatcheu is an unfamiliar name to you, it's perhaps because he has never played for the United States at any level. The Washington D.C.-born forward, who on loan at Swiss giants Young Boys from Ligue 1's Rennes, bagged a hat-trick last week to take his tally for the season to seven goals in 17 games for the Swiss Super League leaders. While things didn't work out for him initially at Rennes, sources tell ESPN that the French club remains quite positive about his future, expecting him to return and fight for a starting place next season.\n\nThe former France Under-21 international remains eligible for the United States and, in an interview with American Soccer Now last year, hinted he would be open to representing the Stars and Stripes. Given the USMNT's uncertainty at striker, don't be surprised if the in-form Siebatcheu receives a call-up from Gregg Berhalter soon.\n\nKonrad de la Fuente, Barcelona -- Holding steady : After surprisingly cracking Barca's first-team out of preseason at the tender age of 19, De la Fuente has faded into the background a bit in recent months. The winger has managed just 26 minutes for Barca so far this campaign and thus has been turning out for Barca B recently to get playing time.\n\nWith Ronald Koeman adamant that youngsters need to play and gain experience, sources tell ESPN that if Barca can keep players fit, the plan now is for him to train with the first team in the week, join up with the B team on Friday or Saturday and then play for them at the weekends. Breaking into a star-studded Barca team was always going to be a tall task for the youngster, and next season Barca will have to decide whether it is best for his development to stay around the first-team again or go out on loan and get minutes.\n\nScouting report: Bryan Reynolds\n\nBryan Reynolds has just 31 MLS appearances to his name and has yet to represent the United States above the Under-18 level, yet two of Italy's biggest clubs, Juventus and AS Roma, were desperate to sign him during the winter transfer window. Why? Potential.\n\nRoma ultimately won the tug-of-war for the 19-year-old right-back, the latest bright talent --Weston McKennie, Chris Richards, Reggie Cannon, etc. -- to emerge from FC Dallas' fruitful development pipeline. What they are getting is a player with huge upside, as Reynolds possesses great size (6'3\") and speed, and is an excellent crosser of the ball. Reynolds' time as a winger earlier in his career also seems to have really benefitted him from an attacking perspective, particularly as a dribbler and in terms of his directness. This past season he picked up three assists for Dallas but with the number of chances he created (16 in 19 games), that figure could have easily been higher.\n\nWhere Reynolds will need to continue to develop is as a defender. While far from a liability this past season, the youngster was inconsistent at times defensively, and he definitely has room to improve when it comes to tracking runners and not getting caught too far forward. This seems to be a common thread with most young full-backs, and given Reynolds' recent position switch, this could simply be dismissed as inexperience at the position.\n\nReynolds is not a player who will jump into Roma's starting XI overnight but he does possess tremendous attacking potential as a full-back long-term, and that is what top clubs are shelling out the big bucks for these days.", "meta_img": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F0209%2Fr812714_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.6471540927886963}, "keywords": ["United States", "Paul Arriola", "Jordan Morris", "Bryan Reynolds", "Roma", "Swansea City", "Christian Pulisic", "Reggie Cannon", "United States", "Major League Soccer", "Swansea City", "Jordan Morris", "Paul Arriola", "Bryan Reynolds", "Reggie Cannon"], "summary": "Both recently completed loan moves to English Championship high - flyers Swansea City -- and could line up against Manchester City this Wednesday in the FA Cup ( 12:30 p.m. ET , ESPN+ ) -- but did so at the relatively advanced age of 26. \n\n The recent exodus continues an ever - growing trend for American stars , with the likes of Christian Pulisic , Weston McKennie , Tyler Adams and Giovani Reyna having all previously crossed the Atlantic as youngsters."}, "category": "Sports"}, {"id": "3613b060-4dab-47df-b465-3cb79c9ae71b", "source": "espn", "data": {"title": "Henderson making his case to be Man United No. 1", "link": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/manchester-united/story/4311651/henderson-wants-to-be-man-united-no-1and-despite-quiet-night-vs-west-hamhes-making-his-case-for-dislodging-de-gea", "description": "West Ham did little to test him, but Dean Henderson nonetheless bolstered his case to take David De Gea's place as Manchester United No. 1.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 03:49:39 EST", "body": "MANCHESTER, England -- For 120 minutes at Old Trafford on Tuesday night, Dean Henderson's main concern was finding a way to stay warm.\n\nDuring flurries of snow on a freezing night in Manchester, West Ham United mustered just one shot on target as Manchester United won their FA Cup fifth-round tie 1-0 thanks to Scott McTominay's goal in extra-time.

It is likely Henderson will be back on the bench for the trip to West Bromwich Albion on Sunday but more games like this -- calm, organised and uncomplicated -- and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's decision will become harder and harder.\n\nHenderson did nothing spectacular against West Ham -- he didn't need to -- but he was still able to show how good of a goalkeeper he is. He was in the right position to comfortably save Said Benrahma's header and when West Ham were searching for a goal in extra-time, he was confident enough to race to the edge of the penalty area and grab Aaron Cresswell's high free kick.\n\nThere is no doubting De Gea's ability as a shot-stopper but he doesn't come off his line to take the pressure off his defenders as often as he should. Henderson did it more than once, and at the end of the first half claimed a Cresswell cross from the left over the head of Andriy Yarmolenko.\n\n\"I always hope our keeper has a quiet night when we play, and most of the time it's happened that way. Today [Henderson] was clean in everything,\" said Solskjaer afterwards. \"Going through is always the main thing in the cup. I was very pleased with the mentality, the attitude and going through.\"\n\nOn loan at Sheffield United last season, Henderson made more saves, claimed more crosses and punched clear more often than De Gea, but there are still aspects of his game Solskjaer and his coaches would like him to work on. At Bramall Lane he was allowed to thump balls up to the halfway line more often, but at United he is expected to help build from the back. In his pre-match news conference, Solskjaer suggested Henderson is getting better with his feet, and the way he turned Tomas Soucek on his own goal line as the final seconds ticked down was evidence of his growing confidence. It was noteworthy that at half-time Henderson was out with a coach, not warming up his hands, but going through passing drills.\n\nDean Henderson did himself no harm against West Ham in his quest to become Man United No. 1. Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images\n\nOften the challenge for a goalkeeper at United is keeping your concentration when most of the action is at the other end. \"David has been used to this for years: to keep concentrated, keep your eye on the ball and suddenly one moment comes up and you have to make a save,\" said Solskjaer.\n\nHenderson still has a job on his hands to oust De Gea permanently. In September 2019, De Gea signed a mammoth contract that could keep him at the club until 2024, and Solskjaer will be reluctant to have one of his highest earners sat on the bench.\n\nFor Henderson, playing regular games is the only way he will continue his development, and even through he has made 11 appearances so far this season, Solskjaer accepts that is not enough. \"He is not the most patient,\" was the Norwegian's pointed comment this week.\n\nSTREAM ESPN FC DAILY ON ESPN+ Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).\n\nSources have told ESPN that Henderson and his representatives are comfortable with Solskjaer's plan for this season.

A thousand years either side, and other such \u201cprimary states\u201d had also arisen across the world, in Mesopotamia, north China, the Indus Valley, and other locations.\n\nBut why did human social dynamics change so dramatically in such a relatively short space of time? Why did we stop living in smaller communities and come together into cities and \u201ccivilizations\u201d?\n\nIn trying to answer this perennial question, archaeologists and anthropologists have historically studied the emergence of social stratification, notions of kingship, shifting identities, changing technologies, and much else. However, these studies\u2014while looking in detail at these \u201chuman factors\u201d \u2013 have arguably overlooked the changing environment within which the people were interacting, just at the crucial juncture. It is almost as if we have been so focused on the \u201cactors\u201d of the narrative, we have missed the \u201cstage.\u201d\n\nOur research recognizes this omission, and has sought to integrate the changing landscapes\u2014the stage\u2014into the discussion, recognizing that actors\u2019 choices may be influenced by the theater or set.\n\nSo what did the \u201cstage\u201d look like for the emergence of Ancient Egypt, or indeed any of these other areas in which the first \u201ccivilizations\u201d arose?\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, until very recently, we really didn\u2019t know.\n\nTo find out, you have to dig. For every meter you drill down into the silts of the Nile Delta, you delve about a thousand years into the past. If you then study the layers of sand and mud at that depth you can begin to piece together a picture of the landscapes from the past.\n\nSo, if you drill lots of boreholes all over the delta (2-10 m deep), study the layers of sand and mud that come up in each one, you can then produce a whole series of maps showing how the delta as a whole looked at different times.\n\nFrom various such drilling programs we are now beginning to understand that in the Nile Delta the landscapes were changing dramatically just as the people here and upstream were beginning to reorganize their social structures. Intriguingly, very similar environmental changes were also taking place in Mesopotamia and north China (other locations where the world\u2019s first state societies emerged).\n\nFurthermore, these shifts in the landscape were not driven by people, but by an external factor: the slowing-down and stabilization of post-glacial sea level rise. The \u201cstage\u201d of the theater upon which the human story played out was indeed evolving by itself, with a natural, inescapable, worldwide driver as the cause.\n\nMud to monuments\n\nBut what were these landscape changes? And could they have nudged the \u201cactors\u201d one way or another? Did they contribute in any way to the emergence of Ancient Egypt?\n\nAnswering the first question is easy: the environments ultimately became less swampy. As sea-level stabilized, rivers started to behave differently. The landscapes gradually evolved from a network of small, dynamic streams crisscrossing a vast expanse of marshland into wider, more open, well-drained floodplains.\n\nAnswering the other questions\u2014establishing if and how these changes impacted on the trajectory of human history\u2014is much harder.\n\nOne way we can attempt this is by studying how people interacted with the environment to source their most basic of needs: food.\n\nIf you analyze the environment in this way, it (perhaps counter-intuitively) turns out the earlier, marshy environments were a great place for people to live. There were plenty of very varied food resources in these extraordinarily rich environments. Of course, you couldn\u2019t farm much very easily, but you could happily fish, hunt, keep a few animals and move around in this veritable \u201cEden\u201d and it would have provided for a large population.\n\nBut, as the environment changed\u2014as the \u201cstage\u201d evolved\u2014the Nile Delta gradually became much less rich in these wild food resources. Over a few hundred years we can calculate that the delta would have lost some 45% of its primary productivity (food potential). Each succeeding generation would have had a slightly harder job of supporting itself.\n\nThe obvious solution was to increase the take-up of farming. Farming is an extraordinarily efficient invention for maximizing the amount of food you can get from a given patch of land. Making the shift would have been easy over a few generations\u2014the inhabitants of the delta were in frequent contact with other societies that were farming wheat, barley, pigs, and cattle, and they could have simply copied.\n\nThis is exactly what we see in the archaeological record. When we analyze what people were eating in this area between 4000-3000 BC it appears that in the swampy landscapes the inhabitants of the delta fished for their food. In the later landscapes they kept pigs and grew more crops. We can even calculate that this shift would have produced a food surplus.\n\nSo it does appear that the landscape changes may have facilitated the inhabitants of the delta farming more through the fourth millennium BC.\n\nBut what was special about this? Plenty of societies have taken up farming in a big way over the last 10 thousand years, yet \u201ccivilizations\u201d did not emerge everywhere.\n\nPerhaps the answer has something to do with the vast size of the Nile Delta, coupled with what was happening upstream. The agricultural potential of the delta was at least 40% larger than the whole of the rest of Egypt (which by this time was a collection of rival \u201cproto-kingdoms\u201d). Any of the local upstream leaders who wanted control over their rivals would have realized that the economic key to power lay in controlling the vast output of the newly agricultural, highly fertile delta, just downstream. The delta\u2019s economic surplus ultimately needed to be brought into the network of a new territorial \u201cstate\u201d structure.\n\nOnce again, this is what we see in the archaeological record. In a short space of time, around 3100 BC, the delta\u2019s surplus was brought under control of the world\u2019s first \u201cnation state\u201d\u2014perhaps even set up in part for that purpose. Early hieroglyphics from this time record transactions into and out of the state treasury, while the \u201ccapital\u201d and royal court were set up at the obvious place\u2014near modern-day Cairo\u2014binding the agricultural powerhouse of the delta with the older centers of culture upstream.\n\nParallels\n\nSo it seems that the natural landscape changes in the Nile Delta may have not only helped stimulate local take up of farming technologies, but might also have played a role in the emergence of the first \u201cnation state\u201d. Broadly similar parallels can be tantalizingly drawn up for Mesopotamia and north China\u2014areas with similar geographies, landscape histories, shifts away from fishing and towards farming, and socio-cultural trends.\n\nWhether such trends are evident in these other settings requires more detailed study. But in doing this we must remember not only to focus on the archaeological record of sites and settlements, but also to look at the changing landscapes. History is not complete without geography. There are ultimately no actors without a stage, and when the stage changes, actors may behave differently.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Then the Londoner was intrigued by what seemed to be an army of retail traders taking a principled stand against Wall Street.\n\nJeram had already made a New Year\u2019s resolution to get into investing, but it was GameStop that inspired him to pull the trigger. \u201cObviously being on Reddit, on social media, it\u2019s more accessible, and people are thinking, OK, so this is clearly a viable way of profit,\u201d he said in a phone call.\n\nJeram is far from alone. Retail trading was already booming in the US and gaining traction in other parts of the world, and the GameStop story turbocharged the trend. Freetrade, the UK-based brokerage app Jeram uses, says daily signups surged from 3,000 before GameStop to as many as 30,000 when news was at a fever pitch. BUX, a Dutch brokerage, said it was onboarding three times as many new customers during the GameStop controversy. Downloads also jumped in Brazil, Japan, and Germany, a country that has been culturally wary of the stock market, according to Apptopia.\n\nYoung guns\n\nThere are signs that the latest cohort of non-US retail traders may be younger and newer to investing. Take Stake, for example. The Australian brokerage has users from Latin America to New Zealand and the UK, and it says the average age of its customers was 29.9 at the end of last year; so far in 2021 the average of its new users is 27.5. It has gotten more than 100,000 signups in the past two months, which is as many as joined in its first three years of operation. Some 25,000 of its new customers came in the past two weeks.\n\nNot everyone who was enticed into trading by the GameStop story is in their 20s, of course. Jordan Pini, 31, who works in sales for Amazon in London, has been investing for the past decade. He started out buying stocks using a bank brokerage in Australia, where he\u2019s from.\n\nUntil recently he had never been on Reddit, and says he would typically be wary of getting financial advice from social-media. Pini used Stake to bet on GameStop, which was mostly about banter and lockdown entertainment, and says he was impressed by how slick the brokerage tech has become, making it much easier to access markets. It also made him think he should be using it on a long-term basis.\n\n\u201cI got into it with my housemate and a couple of our other friends, and I think we all felt the same in that it was refreshing to feel like the little guy could stand up to the big bad boys of Wall Street,\u201d Pini said. \u201cYou as this small punter could have an impact on the biggest financial market in world.\u201d\n\nThese popular narratives matter: They can change the direction of the economy, and can help drive booms as well as depressions, according to Robert Shiller, who won a Nobel prize for his work analyzing financial bubbles. \u201cWe must start understanding how ordinary people, not economists, change, because they make most of the economic decisions,\u201d he said in September during an online event hosted by the London School of Economics. He says human interest stories, with their morals and lessons, are among the most powerful narratives.\n\nLeveling up\n\nDino Jeram Photography Reiss Jeram.\n\nThe retail trading boom isn\u2019t new, but GameStop took it to a new level. The tsunami started to build in late 2019 when a price war among US brokerages stomped out trading commissions. The sensation got a boost after the Covid-19 pandemic shot a hole in the stock market, giving rise to bets that it was a chance to buy stocks on the cheap. It also didn\u2019t hurt that many people were locked down because of the pandemic, with little to do, and those who still had jobs saw their bank accounts swell. The stock market became an outlet for the extra time and money. The enthusiasm for fee-free trading apps has spread outside the US, where retail investing is far less commonplace.\n\nBefore long another story was making the rounds: the idea that lockdowns and social distancing had sped up our digital future. Shares of videoconferencing sensation Zoom and food-delivery Ocado flew off the charts.\n\nThen GameStop came along. The Grapevine, Texas-based company\u2019s shares had drifted lower in recent years amid a broader shift from physical stores and malls to online sales. As short-selling hedge funds ramped up bets that its stock would decline, traders on Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets figured, correctly, that the institutional investors had left themselves exposed to a short squeeze. An army of Redditers was able to drive up the price of GameStop stock, costing hedge fund billions of dollars in losses. Heavy trading in options supercharged the volatility, and professional traders almost certainly piled into the action.\n\n\u201cIt was nice to see that a bunch of Redditers, like my age, had banded together, or put their money into this one share,\u201d Jeram said. \u201cIt did prove to me how powerful social media is, and what it can do linked in to trading.\u201d\n\nSocial media is part of what got Jeram interested in investing in the first place. One of the people who inspired him is Ali Abdaal, a YouTuber in Cambridge with 1.4 million subscribers. Abdaal, who says he makes more money from YouTube than he did as a junior doctor with the UK\u2019s National Health Service, often posts about productivity, how to make money online, and study tips for students. But he also has a video about how he got started \u201cwith this investing thing,\u201d in which he breaks down the basics of index funds and savings. Something that stuck with Jeram was the fact his savings were being eroded by inflation, and that investing could be a way to protect them.\n\n\u201cSeeing how much people were making off of single trades, it\u2019s like, right, this does work, there\u2019s a method to this and there\u2019s a way to do this correctly,\u201d said Jeram, who has appeared in shows on Amazon Prime, Netflix, and BBC.\n\nTaras Mogetich, 21, got started in investing by learning from YouTubers like Pree Market, and he\u2019s a fan of Cathie Wood of ARK Invest, the star stock picker who made seemingly prescient bets on Tesla.\n\nBut the GameStop story didn\u2019t really speak to him. He didn\u2019t think the company had much in the way of future prospects, and he felt the same about AMC, the hard-hit cinema company that\u2019s been a favorite on the forum. For Mogetich, who works in IT and lives outside London, it was the Covid crash in March 2020 that brought him in. He started investing in May and by November was trading more frequently using the the brokerage app Stake.\n\n\u201cThe big factor was the decrease in valuations, seeing the whole market at a discount,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, OK, it\u2019s a good time to set aside some money and get involved in the world of investing.\u201d\n\nThe next stop\n\nGameStop fever seems to be cooling, if trading-app downloads this month are any indication. But retail brokerages are stocked up with a fresh batch of traders who could keep buying and selling even as that story fades.\n\nWhen I interviewed Jeram this week, he said he had put about \u00a370 ($96) into GameStop and that his position was, at that moment, in the red. (Shares were changing hands at about $50 on Feb. 9, down from about $90 a week ago and a closing high of $347 on Jan. 27.) He said the memes were still circulating on Reddit, so he was going to follow the social media trend for now. He\u2019s also also interested in crypto assets like bitcoin, but thinks he needs to do more research on those. If all goes well, he\u2019s hopeful that investing can help make up for some of the turmoil in the acting the business.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-08T182121Z_1080401392_RC2IOL9MG2I0_RTRMADP_3_RETAIL-TRADING-GAMESTOP-e1612949833936.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9898377656936646}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Freetrade , the UK - based brokerage app Jeram uses , says daily signups surged from 3,000 before GameStop to as many as 30,000 when news was at a fever pitch.

A quarter of the employed Americans who participated in the study indicated that they\u2019ve kindled or kept a romantic relationship with a colleague in 2020.\n\nAlex Alonso, SHRM\u2019s chief knowledge officer, isn\u2019t surprised that amorous relationships have flourished within remote teams. For one, easing the borders between our professional and personal lives during Covid-19 has led more people to explore love matches with people they work with. The range of online collaboration tools allow colleagues to get to know each other deeper and faster, he says: \u201cIn Zoom, you\u2019re seeing parts of their personal life much more clearly.\u201d He adds that the loneliness and compounding stresses of remote work during Covid-19 have also made people seek consolation with someone within their company.\n\nThe study also found that 70% of respondents have been involved in an office tryst at some point in their professional careers. This is understandable, Alonso says, given that the average American will spend about 90,000 hours at work throughout our lifetime.\n\nCatherine, a writer and athlete who has explored dating a colleague, attests to why the office is such a conducive milieu for finding a partner. Getting to see someone in various scenarios allowed her to appreciate the qualities of a potential mate more fully. \u201cI would never had gone for him if I had met him on an app,\u201d she tells Quartz. \u201cAt work, I got to see how smart and thoughtful he was.\u201d\n\nThe joys of having a work crush\n\nHuman resource managers are first to point out the risks of letting emotional entanglements seep into the workplace. Companies can be vulnerable to sexual harassment lawsuits or complaints about favoritism, for instance.\n\nBut there can be upsides to harboring an office crush too. \u201cYou\u2019ll start to see that people will actually become much more invested in their work and become more productive,\u201d Alonso explains. \u201cIt provides a reason for them to be more engaged in their work, at least for the first year or so of the relationship.\u201d\n\nTo his point, a 2016 focus group study published in the International Journal of Psychological Studies outlined how workplace romances can bolster morale. The paper, titled \u201cWorkplace Romances: \u2018Going to Work Is Amazing and Really Fun'\u201d cites several benefits:\n\nMany participants expressed their pleasure in going to work when they were in a workplace romance. One participant said the relationship energized him to work even harder and another said this euphoria motivated her to work more. A woman described spending time in the morning trying to be attractive to her new partner: \u201cSuddenly, it was great to go to work. I took more time with my appearance. It was fun to paint my nails. I chose my clothes with extra care.\u201d The men also described their renewed pleasure in going to work: \u201cI also think it was more fun to go to work. It was a boost, quite clearly.\u201d\n\nDating someone working in the same company can also offer a measure of support, given the right parameters. Xenia, a retired project manager who is married to someone she met at work, says it\u2019s important to create a bit of distance even if you work at the same office. \u201cIt helps if you work in different departments,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou\u2019ll get support without having to defend your position in a granular way. Talking after work will be fun because that person would know the characters you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe crush is almost a self-assembled emotional safeguard against giving up and quitting.\u201d\n\nAmy, a former colleague, says she\u2019s never not had a work crush. \u201cIt\u2019s unavoidable not because I tend to have attractive colleagues or because I\u2019m particularly prone to romanticizing near-strangers,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe act of work itself can often, in small moments, feel dull or frustrating, so the crush is almost a self-assembled emotional safeguard against giving up and quitting.\u201d She clarifies that she may never act on these feelings, but crushes provide jolts of inspiration to get her through an arduous day. \u201cThey are motivational coaches that live inside my head,\u201d says Amy.\n\nThese benefits can also apply to \u201cwork spouses,\u201d or close work platonic friendships among colleagues. A 2018 Gallup poll, for example, indicates that women who have a best friend at work are \u201cmore than twice as likely to be engaged.\u201d\n\nLove contracts and working with office romances\n\nSHRM conducts an annual poll on workplace romances to help companies anticipate legal risks. The Virginia-based nonprofit advises organizations about so-called \u201clove contracts,\u201d or corporate policies that address interpersonal relationships among employees. With #MeToo cases and harassment complaints going public, many companies are explicitly outlining rules of engagement in their employee handbooks. One dating policy common among tech companies like Airbnb, Google, and Facebook involves a stipulation against pursuing a coworker if he or she has declined your first invitation.\n\nAlonso, who has worked in HR departments in Latin America, says that worrying about office romance-centered lawsuits tends to be more common in the US and the UK. He cautions against being overly prescriptive with love contracts. \u201cThe only advice I would give to any organization that\u2019s trying to figure out this out is to put a common sense lens on it,\u201d Alonso explains.\u201dTry not to regulate a problem that really doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d As a general rule, he recommends heeding the kernel of GM\u2019s succinct dress code policy. \u201cI try to abide by Mary Barra\u2019s guiding principle,\u201d he says, alluding to GM\u2019s CEO. \u201cIn this case, it would be \u2018act appropriately.'\u201d", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2014-01-31T120000Z_1580588642_GM1EA1V0MD301_RTRMADP_3_JAPAN-ECONOMY-CPI-e1613084321216.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9949153661727905}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "A quarter of the employed Americans who participated in the study indicated that they \u2019ve kindled or kept a romantic relationship with a colleague in 2020. \n\n Despite the fact that many workplaces have been forced to go virtual during the pandemic , the latest survey from the Society for Human Resource Management ( SHRM ) shows a 7 % uptick in office crushes."}, "category": "Business"}, {"id": "cfcf3aa4-9da3-4ff0-b4e7-56e0ec206f67", "source": "quartz", "data": {"title": "The extradition case against Huawei\u2019s CFO comes to London", "link": "https://qz.com/1972171/huawei-cfo-meng-wanzhou-sues-hsbc-in-the-uk/", "description": "Why is Huawei\u2019s Meng Wanzhou suing HSBC in the UK? A look into the complex dynamic between Huawei, HSBC, the UK, and China.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 14:28:53 +0000", "body": "It\u2019s been a rough month for HSBC in the UK.\n\nFirst, in January, the bank\u2019s CEO, Noel Quinn, and its chief compliance officer, Colin Bell, were asked to appear before the foreign affairs committee of Britain\u2019s Parliament to account for HSBC\u2019s support of a repressive security law imposed by authorities in Beijing on Hong Kong six months earlier.\n\nNow, the London-headquartered bank is in the hot seat again, this time in the UK\u2019s Royal Courts of Justice, where a judge heard a case against the bank today (Feb. 12) brought forward by Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei.\n\nWhy is Huawei\u2019s Meng Wanzhou suing HSBC in the UK?\n\nMeng, who is also the daughter of the tech giant\u2019s founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Canada in Dec. 2018 at the request of US law enforcement. The US wants her extradited so she can face charges in the Eastern District of New York for bank fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud.\n\nAt the center of their case is a PowerPoint presentation provided to US authorities by HSBC; it allegedly shows that Meng downplayed Huawei\u2019s relationship with telecoms firm Skycom in an Aug. 2013 meeting with a representative of the bank in a Hong Kong restaurant. That\u2019s important because Reuters has published evidence that Skycom may have violated US trade sanctions against Iran. HSBC says Meng didn\u2019t disclose that Huawei owns a controlling stake in Skycom and that the bank therefore continued to clear transactions for Huawei, which the US alleges includes more than $7 million in payments from Skycom between 2010 and 2014. Because those transactions were in US dollars, they fall under US jurisdiction, meaning that HSBC may have facilitated violations of US sanctions; HSBC says it did so unknowingly, blaming Huawei and Meng.\n\nMeanwhile, Meng\u2019s lawyers argue HSBC was fully aware of Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom, both because her presentation made it clear, and because the information was widely available. They also allege that the US gave Canadian authorities an incomplete version of the presentation in order to convince them to arrest Meng when she flew through Vancouver.\n\nAs a result, Meng is now suing HSBC in the UK under the Bankers\u2019 Book Evidence Act to force the bank to disclose the presentation and other documents in its books, including internal employee communications, compliance records, and risk evaluations. Her lawyers hope to prove their allegation that HSBC executives knew about Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom, and use that to fight the US\u2019s extradition case in Canada. (The next hearing in Meng\u2019s case is scheduled for March 1.)\n\nIn an email statement to Quartz, HSBC said: \u201cThis application for disclosure in the UK is without merit. HSBC is not a party to the underlying criminal case in the US or the extradition proceeding in Canada. It would be inappropriate to comment further on an ongoing legal matter.\u201d A representative for Huawei declined to comment.\n\nHuawei, HSBC, and the UK-China relationship\n\nThis case is the latest chapter in the political saga that is Meng\u2019s case. More broadly, both HSBC and Huawei have repeatedly been caught in the middle of the UK and China\u2019s increasingly tense relationship over the last year.\n\nHuawei was banned from the UK\u2019s telecommunications network after the US prevented Huawei from buying American technology. British authorities warned they could no longer mitigate the security risks of including Chinese-made gear in the UK\u2019s critical infrastructure, and the government said all Huawei equipment had to be stripped from the UK\u2019s networks by 2027.\n\nMeanwhile, a major flashpoint for HSBC has been China\u2019s imposition of a security law in Hong Kong that covers everyone on Earth (yes, including you) and essentially, criminalizes dissent. The UK, Hong Kong\u2019s former colonial power, took the lead in condemning the law, and has since created a bespoke visa to allow Hong Kongers to move to the UK if they want to.\n\nBut HSBC, a London-headquartered bank whose growth comes from China, threw its support behind the law\u2014as did most British banks active in Hong Kong. In a WeChat post, HSBC said one of its chief executives signed a petition in favor of the law. HSBC also closed the bank accounts of activists, media executives, and a donation fund for anti-government protesters, in response to a request from Hong Kong authorities.\n\nMeng\u2019s case has also affected China\u2019s relationship with Canada. In a seemingly retaliatory move following Meng\u2019s arrest, China detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and charged them with spying. They have been detained under harsh conditions. Meanwhile, Meng was released from detention after posting a CAD$10 million ($7.8 million) bail and can leave her luxurious Vancouver home for 17 hours a day, albeit under supervision.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Meng Wanzhou?\n\nThe hearing lasted several hours.\n\nThe lawyer representing HSBC argued that the UK\u2019s Royal Courts of Justice don\u2019t have jurisdiction to rule on Meng\u2019s request and that, even if they did, they should rule against it because not doing so would \u201cimpose an enormous burden on banks in giving disclosures.\u201d The lawyer representing Meng defended the jurisdiction, statutory scope, disclosure burden, and relevance of its disclosure request.\n\nThe judge did not render a judgement in order to further reflect on the case. He said he would lay out his conclusions in writing as soon as possible, within the next seven days.\n\nThis post has been updated.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Meng-Wanzhous-extradition-case-comes-to-London-e1613118110349.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.7506245970726013}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Why is Huawei \u2019s Meng Wanzhou suing HSBC in the UK ?. \n\n Now , the London - headquartered bank is in the hot seat again , this time in the UK \u2019s Royal Courts of Justice , where a judge heard a case against the bank today ( Feb. 12 ) brought forward by Meng Wanzhou , the chief financial officer of Huawei."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "1848d2e2-77e0-4d62-a761-70db313c15d2", "source": "quartz", "data": {"title": "Trump\u2019s defense, Robinhood\u2019s valuation, Lunar New Year rap", "link": "https://qz.com/emails/daily-brief/1972178/", "description": "Our top stories include Trump's impeachment defense, Biden's vaccine promise, and love for Bumble.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 10:50:44 +0000", "body": "\ud83d\udcec Kick off each morning with coffee and the Daily Brief (BYO coffee).\n\nSign me up\n\nBy providing your email, you agree to the Quartz Privacy Policy.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/culture-0122-7.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9902980327606201}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Sign me up \n\n By providing your email , you agree to the Quartz Privacy Policy. \ud83d\udcec Kick off each morning with coffee and the Daily Brief ( BYO coffee )."}, "category": "Business"}, {"id": "e5ba3738-7c6f-4e6f-b30c-f3699fc1b01f", "source": "quartz", "data": {"title": "Funds are emerging to back African female tech founders", "link": "https://qz.com/africa/1969926/investors-are-finally-taking-africas-female-founders-seriously/", "description": "Several African venture funds are turning their focus to female-founded startups, while accelerator programs are bringing more women into their fold.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 07:00:25 +0000", "body": "The next big battles in tech are happening outside the Bay Area.\n\n\ufeffRaising money from investors is a challenging enough task for startup founders in general, but even more so for female entrepreneurs. In 2019, US startups with female CEOs represented only 13.5% (pdf) of all venture capital investments, according to PitchBook, a private markets data provider. Globally, less than 5% of venture capital went to female-led startups in 2019. And the coronavirus pandemic has hit female-led firms disproportionately when it comes to venture funding.\n\nDespite its vibrant and diverse startup sector, this underrepresentation of women in tech is as stark in Africa as it is elsewhere in the world. A 2020 TechPoint report estimated that only 10% of west Africa-focused startups with at least one female co-founder successfully raised $1 million or more in the last decade. The African Development Bank has pitted the entire funding gender gap at $42 billion.\n\nWith venture capital crucial to catalyze business growth, the funding model needs to change. Several African venture funds in recent months have recognized this, and are turning their focus to female-founded startups, while existing funds and accelerator programs are bringing more women into their fold.\n\nFor example, South Africa\u2019s Alitheia IDF fund, which focuses on small to medium businesses with high-growth potential, last year announced it had raised $75 million to invest in mid-sized, women-centred businesses. It plans to invest between $2 million and $5 million in startups from Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Zambia in the coming years.\n\nAlso last year, Janngo Capital, founded by Senegalese entrepreneur Fatoumata Ba, committed 50% of the \u20ac60 million ($82 million) it had raised to startups founded, co-founded, or benefiting women.\n\nAnd more recently, Future Africa, a co-investment VC firm founded by Nigerian serial entrepreneur, Iyin Aboyeji, announced it would invest up to $1 million in women-led startups.\n\n\u201cOur normal system still throws up heavily biased outcomes\u201d against female founders, Aboyeji told TechCabal, a Nigerian publication. \u201cWe believe we\u2019ll make money if we can find the best ones.\u201d\n\nFurther boosting opportunities for female founders, Catalyst Fund, a global startup accelerator, announced that five of the six cohorts for its 2021 Inclusive Fintech Program are led or co-founded by women in emerging markets, including Kenya, South Africa, and Nigeria. Each startup will receive \u00a380,000 ($109,000) in grant capital and six months support and access to investor networks.\n\nAfter consistently supporting all-male teams for years, Catalyst Fund had made \u201ca conscious decision to make this cohort more inclusive for women, given the gap in funding and support to women founders,\u201d Maelis Carraro, Catalyst Fund MD said.\n\nUnder-funded yet over-mentored\n\nStudies have found that the traditional investor pitching and deal sourcing processes often fails women, especially early-stage female entrepreneurs. One 2014 Harvard study details the ways in which this gender bias emerges, with male entrepreneurs 60% more likely to receive funding for their pitches than female entrepreneurs.\n\nOther research finds that traits associated with successful entrepreneurs, such as risk-taking and leadership, are often ascribed to men rather than women. A 2019 Morgan Stanley explored how the idea of the right \u201cfit\u201d compounds the VC funding gap for women and multicultural entrepreneurs.\n\nAs a result, a strong emphasis has sprung up on training so as to \u201cimprove\u201d their abilities to manage teams and access investor networks. All too often, this creates a system where female founders are over-mentored yet underfunded, says Eloho Omame, managing director of Endeavor Nigeria, a program for high-impact entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cThe investment system isn\u2019t working very well for women, and someone needs to fix it.\u201d\n\nThis manifests in different ways. For example, female entrepreneurs are often trained to pitch differently from their male peers. A 2018 study of MBA students professors at INSEAD and Harvard, showed that female-led ventures are perceived to be less viable on average. But that sentiment significantly changes when the emphasis is on social impact. This bias and pattern matching doesn\u2019t only influence the pitch process. It could also relegate women entrepreneurs to funding like grants, instead of the risk capital they desperately need to grow and scale.\n\n\u201cThe [investment] system isn\u2019t working very well for women, and someone needs to fix it,\u201d Omame says.\n\nOmame is working with Odunayo Eweniyi, a 2019 Quartz Africa Innovator and the COO of Piggyvest, a fast-growing Nigerian fintech, to address the funding gap for women. In January, they created FirstCheck Africa, a female-focused angel investing fund set up to back technology entrepreneurs at \u201cridiculously early\u201d stages.\n\nThe fund will invest between $15,000 and $25,000 in female-led teams, with the goal of being the first outside investor backing founders. FirstCheck did not disclose to Quartz how much equity it is looking to get, but at a recent Clubhouse event, Odunayo explained that it will vary on a deal-by-deal basis. Over the next ten months, the fund plans to back six female founders, supporting them through ideation to a \u201csignificant\u201d pre-seed round within 12 months.\n\nFirstCheck joins a growing number of not just African startup investment funds but angel funds with a gender-lens. Similar female-focused angel funds include Rising Tide Africa, a Lagos-based network, and Dazzle Angels in South Africa.\n\nAnd like the others, FirstCheck isn\u2019t just a funding initiative. It is building a community of female entrepreneurs, and developing a pipeline to make it easier for women to start their own companies and confidently raise their first capital, steps crucial to their success.\n\nFor many startup founders, early-stage investment is more likely to come in the form of informal funding\u2014the so-called \u201cfriends and family\u201d round\u2014than angel investors, as founders discuss their business ideas with people in their network. But at this stage, ideas are ripe for feedback, or to be reshaped for better execution.\n\n\u201cThe best way to support female founders is to act consistently and with conviction, and commit risk capital.\u201d\n\nAt the root of the issue is that the number of women working in tech is relatively low. A McKinsey report from 2016 (pdf) showed that women held only 33% of senior management positions in African media, telecoms, and the technology industries. A more significant number of work in non-management positions. FirstCheck\u2019s goal is to tap into this pool of female leaders who may not have the minimum capital to participate in typical VC funds, but would like to invest and share their knowledge and access to their network.\n\n\u201cThe best way to support female founders is to act consistently and with conviction, and commit risk capital,\u201d Eweniyi, FirstCheck\u2019s co-founder says. The fund aims to work with women to \u201ctake their ideas to MVP [minimum viable product], build early traction, and raise their next funding rounds.\u201d\n\nAlthough this would take some work, it may influence a shift in thinking among other investors regarding female-led businesses in Africa.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2020-01-21T104343Z_1_LYNXMPEG0K0WU_RTROPTP_4_KENYA-SEX-e1612786834134.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9985479116439819}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Globally , less than 5 % of venture capital went to female - led startups in 2019.

Nebula Caravel Acquisition\u2014a SPAC created by True Wind Capital, a private equity firm\u2014will acquire Rover, which will retain its management team and get an infusion of fresh capital. The new company, which will be renamed Rover Group and trade as ROVR on the Nasdaq, will be worth $1.6 billion in total.\n\nThe development represents the meeting of two trends in American business: the rise of the SPAC as a means of raising capital, and the rapid growth of the pet industry. SPACs act as blank checks for financiers who raise money through initial public offerings on public stock markets, then use the proceeds to acquire promising companies. Companies can use SPACs to avoid the hassles and uncertainty of a traditional IPO; they raised a record $80 billion last year.\n\nIt was perhaps inevitable that a SPAC would be deployed for a company devoted to pets, since venture capital and private equity firms have been gorging themselves on pet deals lately. The US pet care industry is estimated to be worth $100 billion a year and growing by about 4% to 5% annually. Driven by the changing relationship between pet owners and their companions, Americans are spending more on pet food, pet care, and veterinary services.\n\nRover is well positioned to take advantage of that dynamic.

In less than two years, SpaceX launched more than 1,000 new satellites for its Starlink constellation, becoming the world\u2019s largest satellite operator and increasing the number of active satellites by nearly a third.\n\nHow extraordinary is that?\n\nNot very, according to SpaceX, which is pushing back against environmental complaints that could have major consequences for satellite operators trying to launch huge new constellations in low-earth orbit.\n\nIn the US, satellite activity is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, which is responsible for ensuring that spacecraft transmitting under US jurisdiction don\u2019t interfere with each other and that the US meets its international space treaty obligations.\n\nIn practice, the FCC is a venue for companies battling over valuable real estate in orbit and on the radio spectrum. With SpaceX far ahead of potential competitors in the internet satellite business, it has a target on its back. But it also has to reckon with the other burden of being the first mover: the unanticipated consequences of all those bold moves.\n\nOne of those surprises was the fact that SpaceX satellites, particularly shortly after launch, are unusually visible from earth. Astronomers fear that as the number of satellites grows, some very expensive terrestrial telescopes won\u2019t be able to work as well. To its credit, SpaceX has stepped up its efforts to reduce the glare.\n\nWhen astronomers first came to grips with the problem of SpaceX\u2019s satellites, one law student suggested that US environmental regulations could give astronomers a chance to challenge SpaceX\u2019s license to operate its satellites. Experienced attorneys I spoke to at the time thought there was little chance that an outside lawsuit, making arguments not mentioned in the pre-license debate, would threaten SpaceX\u2019s activities.\n\nNow SpaceX is seeking to modify its license by shifting more than 2,000 planned satellites from an orbit above 1,000 kilometers down to lower altitudes between 540 km and 570 km. One of its competitors, ViaSat, has asked the FCC to perform a full environmental review of this request, an action that becomes more likely in the midst of a regulatory procedure.\n\n\u201cMost things that the FCC does are not going to have a significant environmental impact,\u201d John Janka, an attorney who works on regulatory issues at ViaSat, told Quartz. \u201cSpaceX is asking for 42,000 operating satellites which have a lifetime of five years. Over a 15-year FCC license term, we\u2019re talking about well over 100,000 satellites. This is unprecedented and it is appropriate for the agency to consider these consequences.\u201d\n\nViaSat\u2019s concerns have included traditional issues like radio interference and the potential for orbital collisions and debris. These technical issues are the bread and butter of satellite regulation, but the unusually large number of satellites in SpaceX\u2019s constellation increases the complications.\n\nViaSat notes that SpaceX originally said its satellites would become inoperable at a rate of less than 1%, but losses have been closer to 2.8%. Failed satellites that can\u2019t be controlled eventually fall out of orbit and burn up, but in the meantime present a higher risk of collision. The lower orbit of these spacecraft is also more crowded than the old one, and the satellites will by flying closer together.\n\nAstroscale, a company developing technology to service satellites and clean orbital debris, concurred with ViaSat that the FCC needs to do more analysis on the risk of Starlink collisions. Charity Weeden, a policy executive at Astroscale, wrote that there is \u201cnot yet sufficient certainty or evidence of the modification\u2019s increase in space safety\u201d and that SpaceX\u2019s arguments \u201clack mathematical substantiation.\u201d\n\nViaSat\u2019s list of concerns includes less widely discussed ways that space activity can pollute. Rocket exhaust and spacecraft, from defunct satellites to rockets, burning up in the atmosphere can leave behind particulate pollution. The Aerospace Corporation released a preliminary estimate last year that this could increase from the current annual level of \u201croughly 100 metric tons to between 800 and 3,200 metric tons.\u201d The researcher who led the study, William Ailor, told SpaceNews that \u201cgiven the present and anticipated increase in large constellations, there is potential for environmental impact.\u201d\n\nSpaceX, which declined interview requests on this topic over the last month, isn\u2019t impressed with ViaSat\u2019s complaints. Its lawyers called ViaSat\u2019s arguments \u201canti-competitive gamesmanship\u201d that is \u201cself-serving and misguided,\u201d and complained about its \u201cfeigned interest in environmental protection.\u201d\n\nIn its filings, SpaceX argues that lowering its satellites would actually decrease their impact on astronomers, an idea endorsed by the American Astronomical Society, and make them safer, since failed satellites will burn up sooner at lower altitudes. In the end, its asserts that since these specific satellites were already approved for launch, any environmental concerns about its modifications should be judged in comparison to that status quo.\n\nThat argument could win at the FCC, but the timing of the dispute might hurt SpaceX. The top FCC official when it approved SpaceX\u2019s license, Ajit Pai, stepped down with the new administration. Now Jessica Rosenworcel is the acting chair, and she has expressed concern about space debris before.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration has indicated that it intends to focus on environmental issues and\u2026that it is committed to a science-based analysis underlying its policy-making,\u201d Janka says. \u201cAssuming they are going to do what they say, I imagine they would be interested in looking a these issues.\u201d\n\nFor the rest of us, there\u2019s a bigger issue: SpaceX is hardly the player with plans to loft thousands of new satellites; ViaSat, too, plans to expand its network. Orbital collisions and the potential for atmospheric pollution as spacecraft burn up in orbit are only going to get more likely, and it might behoove someone to look into it rigorously.\n\nSpaceX argues that the environmental regulations at hand can only be applied by the FCC if \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d suggest its activities may have a \u201csignificant impact.\u201d\n\nThe incredible growth in satellite deployment in the recent years seems extraordinary, but don\u2019t take my word for it. Consider how a less modest SpaceX described its own work to the FCC when requesting this very modification, noting the \u201cunprecedented deployment of hundreds of satellites within months of the Commission granting SpaceX\u2019s first modification.\u201d", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Starlink-satellite-Elon-Musk-SpaceX-ViaSat-environmental-NEPA-FCC.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.719455361366272}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "In less than two years , SpaceX launched more than 1,000 new satellites for its Starlink constellation , becoming the world \u2019s largest satellite operator and increasing the number of active satellites by nearly a third. \n\n Not very , according to SpaceX , which is pushing back against environmental complaints that could have major consequences for satellite operators trying to launch huge new constellations in low - earth orbit."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "52195599-a1bf-4d55-b554-6fe2d7ffd036", "source": "quartz", "data": {"title": "Robinhood shares are soaring just like the stocks that trade on Robinhood", "link": "https://qz.com/1971633/robinhood-pre-ipo-secondary-shares-signal-40-billion-valuation/", "description": "Investors scramble to get a piece of the brokerage before a much anticipated IPO", "published": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 17:09:40 +0000", "body": "Shares of Robinhood jumped 50% in January despite the GameStop controversy, as investors scramble to get a piece of the brokerage before a much anticipated IPO this year.

That\u2019s about double the proposed IPO valuation that Reuters reported in December, citing people familiar with the discussions. Robinhood was valued at $11.7 billion in its private fundraising round in September.\n\nPrivate-company shares are illiquid and difficult to trade, and information about those transactions can be hard to come by.\n\nLast month, Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev was forced to defend his company against conspiracy theories that the platform was in cahoots with hedge funds, which had been betting against GameStop. As volatility in video game retailer\u2019s shares skyrocketed, the clearinghouse that processes stock transactions required brokerages like Robinhood to put up more collateral. Tenev, whose company didn\u2019t have the funds to cover the requirement, briefly restricted the buying of GameStop shares and a few other volatile stocks on Jan. 28 while he went about raising a whopping $3.4 billion from investors. Some market structure experts said the events raised questions about whether Robinhood had set aside enough capital. Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade said they didn\u2019t have to halt trading in any stocks despite the volatility.\n\nInstead of damaging Robinhood\u2019s valuation, bids for the company\u2019s shares rose. \u201cWhat they really had was just the biggest free media advertising that they could have ever hoped for,\u201d said Greg Martin, partner at Liquid Stock, which provides financing for shares of pre-IPO companies.\n\nThe viral sensation resulted in a surge in app downloads for all brokerages\u2014but especially for Robinhood, according to compiled by Apptopia.\n\nRobinhood has had other missteps over the years. The Menlo Park, California-based company was beset by tech outages in March 2020, which its founders said were \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and took too long to fix. The brokerage paid a $65 million fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission in December for failing to disclose that it was getting paid for routing users\u2019 orders to trading firms, and that it failed to seek out the best possible deal for its customers. Robinhood neither admitted nor denied the SEC\u2019s findings.\n\nDespite occasional controversy, Robinhood has powered ahead. In Martin\u2019s view, that\u2019s because the app is so slick and easy to use and because the company has such wide name recognition. Investors, meanwhile, have been gobbling up private shares of tech companies in hopes of getting ahead of the IPO mania in the US.\n\nAs for Robinhood, the company will get a closer examination next week when an executive from the brokerage is reportedly expected to testify before a House panel on Feb. 18.

Now that they\u2019re finally trickling out into the waiting arms of the public, it\u2019s still not enough to go back to normal.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons for these delays. Some are related to ongoing research: Scientists are still investigating how well available vaccines protect against new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and how well they prevent transmission. Others fall outside the realm of science, like manufacturing bottlenecks, distribution challenges, vaccine hesitancy, and fear of medical establishments spreads through social media.\n\nRegardless of the reasons why the Covid-19 vaccines haven\u2019t brought us to a new normal, \u201cpandemic fatigue\u201d has set in. Despite the speed with which these vaccines were developed, roadblocks and uncertainties\u2014and the precautions they necessitate\u2014are leading to disillusionment with vaccines in general.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to let this exasperation undermine our optimism that the pandemic will ever end. But only talking about the problems vaccines can\u2019t or haven\u2019t yet solved makes us forget that vaccines are vital public health power tools. And although all tools need to be used effectively to get a job done, they\u2019re still worth celebrating.\n\nInvisible infrastructure\n\nThe most successful vaccination effort to date eliminated the pathogen it protected us from.\n\nIn 1980, the World Health Organization declared that smallpox was officially eradicated. That disease, also caused by a virus, killed one-third of the people it infected, and left others blind or with disfiguring scars.\n\nIt didn\u2019t happen overnight. Edward Jenner concocted the smallpox vaccine, the first against a pathogen, (with incredibly questionable study methods) in 1796. It was the first vaccine against an infectious disease. And yet, it would take almost 200 years to vaccinate enough people to stop the spread of the disease entirely.\n\nMore recently, the polio vaccine has nearly eradicated the virus. A handful of outbreaks still exist in Pakistan, Nigeria, and Afghanistan where violence and political instability have kept healthcare providers from delivering vaccines.\n\nThough these vaccinations are success stories, they\u2019re partly a product of circumstance. Polio largely affects children, which means it\u2019s logistically easier to ensure they receive their shots. In many jurisdictions, schools require children to receive the polio vaccine (among others) which serves as something of a checkpoint that entire generations have to pass through. And though Jenner\u2019s smallpox vaccine came before modern medicine (and manufacturing), it was easier to quarantine incoming ships or sick patients, so the virus spread more slowly\n\nBut with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, \u201cwe\u2019ve set ourselves a bigger challenge than we had in the past,\u201d says Amy Bix, a medical historian at the University of Iowa.\n\nFor one thing, the virus targets people of all ages. Adults don\u2019t have the universal vaccination requirements like students. The only requirements for adult vaccinations today are for international travel, and even those are rare. For another, SARS-CoV-2 has unprecedented opportunities to spread. Globalization and advances in travel give infections the opportunity to jump from country to country in a matter of hours instead of days or weeks.\n\nOf course, there are tremendous benefits to living in a modern, global society. Other medical advancements\u2014including other vaccines\u2014have raised life expectancies globally. We don\u2019t even know how many cases of measles or mumps vaccines have been prevented because it\u2019s impossible to prove, says Bix. And technological feats enable near instant communication with friends across the world. For the most part, we\u2019re used to living free from fear of dying young, and having quick solutions to any problem at our fingertips.\n\nHistory is full of examples of progress benefiting only a select group of people, but vaccines, for the most part, stand out for having benefited the majority of people on the planet. We just don\u2019t see them that way because we\u2019re so accustomed to life with their protection.\n\nThe problems Covid-19 vaccines can\u2019t solve\n\nIn terms of Covid-19 vaccines, plenty of progress remains to be made. Some of it just takes time. Despite developing and administering vaccines against Covid-19 within a year of discovering the virus, pharmaceutical companies are still studying if different kinds Covid-19 vaccines can be mixed, how long they\u2019ll offer immune protection, and to what degree they stop transmission. \u201cThe thing about medical research is there are some parts you can hurry and there are some parts you literally can\u2019t,\u201d says Bix.\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of vaccine inequalities that need to be addressed, too. \u201cPrioritization plans have taken racial equity into account, but only nominally,\u201d Julia Marcus, an epidemiologist at Harvard University, wrote in The Atlantic. The groups most likely to develop Covid-19 are the ones least likely to get vaccines. They\u2019re also most likely to suffer disproportionate economic hardships, something the pandemic has exacerbated.\n\nKnowing that vaccines can\u2019t solve all the problems caused by the pandemic, we have to look elsewhere. \u201cWe have to think, \u2018How could we make life better for people who had things worse?\u2019\u201d Bix says. This is where community leaders and politics come in: They can shape how to educate and prioritize vaccine recipients, or control the funding that could alleviate some of the other pandemic-induced hardships.\n\nIn all of modern medicine, vaccines have served as tools. They\u2019ve never been a complete fix, and certainly can\u2019t be a solution to a pandemic of Covid-19\u2019s magnitude. But by focusing only on the uncertainties around them, or how they\u2019ve failed to reopen society yet, we lose sight of how powerful they actually are: Slowly but surely, fewer people will get sick, and fewer will be hospitalized. Severe cases will be reduced to mild. And eventually, we will reach a new normal where restaurants, travel, and parties will once again be safe.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-01-29T123417Z_1331386418_RC2OHL9XHAZZ_RTRMADP_3_HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-BRITAIN-VACCINE-e1612472721884.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.993359386920929}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Countries that never got the pandemic under control \u2014 like the US , the UK , and Brazil \u2014 have waited patiently for a Covid-19 vaccine. \n\n Regardless of the reasons why the Covid-19 vaccines have n\u2019t brought us to a new normal , \u201c pandemic fatigue \u201d has set in."}, "category": "Business"}, {"id": "2a7797f2-762f-4f1b-acdd-0f62398365ea", "source": "quartz", "data": {"title": "Graphic riot video, Bumble\u2019s rise, 3D-printed steaks", "link": "https://qz.com/emails/daily-brief/1971635/", "description": "Our top stories include: new video of the Capitol riot, Bumble\u2019s rise in the online dating industry, and Netflix\u2019s French shift.", "published": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 10:48:00 +0000", "body": "\ud83d\udcec Kick off each morning with coffee and the Daily Brief (BYO coffee).\n\nSign me up\n\nBy providing your email, you agree to the Quartz Privacy Policy.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/phenology-obsession-featured-image.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9584751725196838}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Sign me up \n\n By providing your email , you agree to the Quartz Privacy Policy. \ud83d\udcec Kick off each morning with coffee and the Daily Brief ( BYO coffee )."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "cec3c2d7-7a7e-4b8d-b8d1-29c36785f464", "source": "quartz", "data": {"title": "Indian Americans may not have supported Trump\u2014but their approval of Modi is largely intact", "link": "https://qz.com/india/1971595/even-the-american-nris-who-dislike-trump-seem-to-like-modi/", "description": "The Indian American community is key for Modi, especially given that non-resident Indian (NRI) voters would soon be allowed to vote by post during Indian elections.", "published": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 09:40:12 +0000", "body": "How borders are drawn and enforced has far-reaching consequences, whether we live on either side of them or halfway across the world.\n\nIndian Americans view prime minister Narendra Modi largely approvingly.\n\nAnd his popularity in the community has remained irrespective of their support for Trump, according to findings from the Indian American Attitudes Survey. A large number of those who approve of Trump also approve of Modi. But among those who disapprove of Trump, Modi\u2019s approval numbers are still higher than those who disapprove of him.\n\nThe second part of the survey, conducted between Sept. 1 and 20, 2020 and analysed by political scientists Sumitra Badrinathan, Devesh Kapur, and Milan Vaishnav, captures how political affiliations and ideologies within the community shift between the US and India.\n\nModi may have projected his bonhomie with former US president Donald Trump for diplomatic reasons, but there was a key demographic he was signalling to.\n\nIndian Americans, who have emerged as a financially and socially influential minority group in the US, were the focus of Modi\u2019s visit to the US in September 2019, and Trump\u2019s visit to India in February 2020. Both Modi and Trump hoped that the community, which largely votes and has voted for the Democratic party in US presidential elections, would vote Trump back to power.\n\nThough that was not to be, the Indian American community is key for Modi, especially given that non-resident Indian (NRI) voters would soon be allowed to vote by post during Indian elections.\n\nModi\u2019s popularity in the diaspora\n\nModi has often projected his popularity among Indian Americans through mega-events and rallies in the US. In September 2014, for instance, he held a massive event at the Madison Square Garden in New York during his maiden official visit to the US. The Howdy, Modi! event in Houston in September 2020 was attended by nearly 50,000 people, most of them from the Indian diaspora.\n\nDespite protests against Modi\u2019s visit outside the Howdy, Modi! venue, he continues to be popular in the community. Nearly half of the Indian American community also approves of Modi\u2019s work as prime minister.\n\nThis approval rating, when seen on the basis of the religion of the respondents, brings out the latent differences within the Indian American community. \u201cThe religious divide is striking. Almost seven in 10 Hindus approve of Modi\u2019s performance, while just one in five Muslims do the same,\u201d the authors of the paper write.\n\nThe researchers further demonstrate who is a Modi supporter.\n\n\u201cConventional wisdom suggests that the typical Modi supporter in the United States is male, older, Republican-leaning, Hindu, and hails from Gujarat or other regions of India where the [Modi\u2019s] Bharatiya Janata Party is traditionally dominant,\u201d the researchers said. But the degree of this support changes across age, religion, and even occupation.\n\nBesides Modi\u2019s popularity, Indian Americans are divided on their position towards controversial laws in India, including the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register for Citizens (NRC). Between December 2019 and March 2020, India saw widespread protests against the two laws that were discriminatory on the basis of religion.\n\nSocial threats in India vs the US\n\nHindu Indian Americans appear to see white supremacy as a social threat. But the same group of respondents does not see Hindu majoritarianism and a polarised Indian society under Modi in the same light.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/modi-popular-among-indian-americans-e1613023237880.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.999515950679779}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Indian Americans view prime minister Narendra Modi largely approvingly.

The initiative is designed to help poorer countries deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile the question of how Ethiopia deals with its debts\u2014particularly through this program\u2014is extremely important, it is just one aspect of the country\u2019s recovery from the pandemic, and future prosperity. A major challenge is how it can increase trade and exports, which currently contribute only 7.9% to its GDP, one of the lowest in Africa. This is a major goal of Teshome Toga, Ethiopia\u2019s ambassador to China for the last two years.\n\nIn an exclusive interview for our Africa Unconstrained: Perspectives on the Continent\u2019s New Era video series, in partnership with Quartz Africa, the ambassador discussed the Ethiopian government\u2019s strategy for working with China, and its focus on increasing and adding value to exports to the country.\n\nHow and why? The Beijing-based ambassador is keenly aware that China\u2019s new Covid-19 domestic recovery strategy, which focuses on what the government calls \u201cdual circulation,\u201dcould have big implications for African countries\u2019 trade flows. China hopes with this strategy to grow its domestic consumer market as well as high-tech manufacturing, and reduce the country\u2019s dependency on exports of low-value manufactured goods, and on singular sources of imports into China.\n\nThis new strategy could be positive for Africa, in contrast to countries that currently export value-added, high-tech products to China, such as the US, Germany, France or the UK. In 2018, African countries made up just 4.1% of China\u2019s imports, primarily raw natural resources and agricultural goods. The continent may benefit from the trade diversification and consumer market growth the new policy implies.\n\nAt least that\u2019s what Toga is betting on whenever he travels across China, or joins live-streaming sessions to promote Ethiopia as a trade and investment destination to Chinese consumers, manufacturers, and local government leaders.\n\nIn our interview, Toga, who was previously Ethiopia\u2019s public enterprises minister, talks candidly about the challenges the country is currently facing in paying for the country\u2019s continuing Covid-19 response, as well as the government\u2019s aspirations to attract more concessional loans from China and more direct investment from Chinese companies (the interview took place prior to Ethiopia\u2019s application to the G20 program.) The need is stark. For all its growth over the last decade, 82% of the Ethiopian population still don\u2019t have access to the internet, 70% don\u2019t have access to drinking water, while 55% don\u2019t have access to electricity.\n\nThe ambassador also shares his view on the importance of African countries working together collaboratively to get the most out of the relationship with China and other development partners.\n\nThis interview is the second in our Africa Unconstrained video series, following our first on the African debt narrative. Throughout 2021, Development Reimagined and Quartz Africa will be sharing insights from key African thought leaders on some of the trickiest questions of African economics, and the relationship between African countries and China.\n\nWatch the interview with Ambassador Toga here and visit the bespoke website, www.africaunconstrained.com, for more information.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2019-04-24T103845Z_1419843361_RC1EA412DE00_RTRMADP_3_CHINA-SILKROAD-e1612952843653.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.994149923324585}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The initiative is designed to help poorer countries deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

But despite the continued cloud of the Covid-19 pandemic hanging over retailing, Simon Property Group, the country\u2019s biggest mall owner, is optimistic about 2021, especially for its properties Florida.\n\nSimon operates more than 200 properties in 38 states, all of which had to shutter operations in late March due to the pandemic. Social distancing measures and the rising popularity of e-commerce have continued to hurt foot traffic and sales at many malls and outlet centers, even during the holidays.\n\nOn Feb. 8, Simon reported weaker year-over-year profits for its latest quarter ending on Dec. 31, with revenues falling by about 24%. With many retail and restaurant tenants struggling to stay open, Simon granted more than $750 million in rent deferrals or reductions for the quarter. Its occupancy rate also dropped to 91.3%, compared to 95.1% during the same period a year ago.\n\nDespite all of this, Simon CEO David Simon expressed optimism about this year during a call with analysts and investors. The company collected 90% of its net billed rents from its US properties for the last three fiscal quarters and at the end of last year, Simon acquired a majority stake in The Taubman Group, the owner of 27 high-end shopping centers. Simon specifically singled out the state of Florida for its energy, its \u201cvibrant economy\u201d, and increased domestic traffic to the 22 Simon properties in Florida. \u201dWe feel confident we\u2019ve turned the corner,\u201d Simon said, noting that South Florida was one of the hottest markets for mixed-used redevelopment for \u201centertainment-oriented retailers\u201d. \u201cThe healthy retailers that believe in their business\u2014believe in their plans\u2014are making deals.\u201d\n\nA bleak situation for retailers\n\nSimon\u2019s positive outlook is far from the norm in the US commercial real estate and the retail industry. Dozens of companies filed for bankruptcy last year while other retailers announced the closure of more than 12,000 stores. Landlord concerns about additional tenant evictions, empty stores, and reduced foot traffic have prompted billions of commercial rent relief. These include concessions on lease payments, longer payment terms, changes to lease timelines, permanently lowered rents, and even forgiveness on past-due payments, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhile overall retail sales in the US have risen to levels higher than before the pandemic, it\u2019s largely due to increased consumer purchases of sporting goods, hobbies, home renovation and gardening supplies, personal care, and to online shopping. Several retail categories that make up core tenants of malls and shopping outlets\u2014like clothing and department stores\u2014are still recording sales levels much lower than prior to the pandemic, according to the most recent advanced estimates from the US Census Bureau.\n\nGrowing health concerns\n\nSimon\u2019s optimism about Florida is also in contrast to the state\u2019s current Covid-19 situation. In addition to a rising number of new deaths from Covid-19 and nearly 1.8 million cases (15th highest for per capita hospitalizations in the country), there are also 201 cases of the fast-spreading UK strain of the virus, the most of any state according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many Floridians also can\u2019t afford to shop at Simon\u2019s properties right now. In December, the state unemployment rate was 6.1%, more than twice as high as before the pandemic.\n\nSimon\u2019s optimism may be due to Florida\u2019s more relaxed approach to coronavirus-related restrictions. In September, governor Ron DeSantis issued an executive order that moved Florida to Phase 3 of its reopening plan. This allowed all businesses to reopen, no longer restricted occupancy at restaurants and bars, and suspended fines and other penalties for people who did not social distance or follow mask mandates.\n\nThe state\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal 2021-2022 also included $65 million in tax relief for two sales-tax holidays. Prior to the pandemic, these tax holidays significantly increased Florida\u2019s retail sales and made back-to-school the second-highest sales period after Black Friday, according to Florida Tax Watch, a research institute and government watchdog organization.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2014-12-07T120000Z_2130714395_GF2EAC71B1802_RTRMADP_3_USA-RETAIL-e1612991985251.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9993053674697876}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Simon operates more than 200 properties in 38 states , all of which had to shutter operations in late March due to the pandemic.

We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nNetflix announced today its biggest move yet toward that dream of beating Disney at what it does best. The company acquired the rights to all 22 books of Redwall, the award-winning children\u2019s fantasy series by English writer Brian Jacques about the adventures of a group of anthropomorphic animals. Netflix will produce an animated film based on the first book of the series, as well a develop an \u201cevent series\u201d (also animated) about the character Martin the Warrior, a heroic mouse.\n\nPublished from 1986 until Jacques\u2019 death in 2011, Redwall sold more than 30 million copies and has been translated into 20 languages, enthralling multiple generations of children around the world. It has long topped wishlists to be adapted into a big-budget Hollywood film or TV series, and now Netflix will get a crack at it.\n\nThe news comes as Netflix rapidly builds out its still nascent animation unit to cut into Disney\u2019s lead in the space. It now plans to release six animated movies per year\u2014far more than the two that Disney\u2019s main animation studios (Pixar and Walt Disney Animation) put out each year.\n\nFor a company primarily in the business of growing global subscriptions, animation helps make families more loyal customers. One way to increase the odds households not only turn into Netflix households, but also stay that way, is to offer content that appeals to all members of that household\u2014especially as subscription prices rise. Netflix has said its data show children watch the same animated movies repeatedly.\n\nThe genre also represents a chance to undermine Disney\u2019s streaming growth around the world. Disney has been producing animated films since the 1930s and has remained a juggernaut in the space, routinely topping the box office with films like Frozen, and Toy Story. In 2019, two of the three highest-grossing films in the world, Frozen II and the Lion King remake, were Disney animated films. While other challengers have emerged in the last few decades, no other studio has made a serious dent in Disney\u2019s animation dominance. Disney bought the one studio that came close\u2014Pixar.\n\nSo developing a robust animation slate could help Netflix fend off Disney\u2019s streaming challenge. To some extent, it could be a mere show of force\u2014one last hill for Netflix to conquer after it\u2019s proven capable of succeeding virtually everywhere else.\n\nIn addition to making more animated originals, Netflix is bolstering its licensed slate of animated titles. Last year, it acquired the international rights to 21 films from Studio Ghibli, the famed Japanese animation studio responsible for Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. (In the US, Studio Ghibli\u2019s catalog is available on HBO Max.) Netflix is developing a number of animated co-productions with other studios too, including the stop-motion horror-comedy Wendell and Wild, co-written by and starring Jordan Peele.\n\nNetflix acknowledges dethroning Disney won\u2019t happen overnight, if ever. \u201cThat\u2019s going to take a while,\u201d Hastings told the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI mean, they are really good at it.\u201d But that the company intends for it to happen at all is another clear sign of its limitless ambition.\n\nMeanwhile, yesterday Disney shuttered Blue Sky Studios, the animation studio that made the Ice Age and Rio film series, and one of the last vestiges of its 2019 acquisition of Fox\u2019s entertainment empire. Citing the financial squeeze brought on by the pandemic, Disney no longer has the desire (or means) to operate a third animation division. According to Deadline, Disney will absorb Blue Sky\u2019s remaining intellectual property (and help place some of its employees at the company\u2019s other studios)\u2014perhaps to prevent Netflix from doing so.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/redwall-netflix-e1612968591331.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.997995913028717}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The company acquired the rights to all 22 books of Redwall , the award - winning children \u2019s fantasy series by English writer Brian Jacques about the adventures of a group of anthropomorphic animals. \n\n Published from 1986 until Jacques \u2019 death in 2011 , Redwall sold more than 30 million copies and has been translated into 20 languages , enthralling multiple generations of children around the world."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "9a279669-e2ec-4a3a-a2f0-94f565e1d564", "source": "quartz", "data": {"title": "Netflix is ushering in a golden age of French TV", "link": "https://qz.com/1971104/netflix-is-bringing-great-french-tv-shows-to-global-audiences/", "description": "Shows like Lupin, Call My Agent!, or Marseille are written for French audiences but have global appeal, making them good investments for Netflix.", "published": "Wed, 10 Feb 2021 16:22:54 +0000", "body": "In a global industry dominated by Hollywood (pdf), French cinema has long punched above its weight.\n\nIn 2018, of the 696 European films released outside Europe, 191 were French (pdf, p. 48). France has earned the most Academy Award nominations for best international feature film and classics like Am\u00e9lie, The Artist, or The Intouchables have turned into mainstream hits.\n\nBut until recently, French television lagged behind. While France is one of the three leading producing countries in Europe for high-end series\u2014a nebulous concept that typically refers to \u201cshort series made for primetime\u201c\u2014its shows didn\u2019t have broad popular appeal in the same way its movies do. That\u2019s partly down to money; Disney or Universal can spend more on promotion than French studios. But it\u2019s also true that the global market for non-English-language shows is relatively small and, while it\u2019s grown over time, the competition is fierce. (Think of hits like Money Heist or Unorthodox.)\n\nWith the advent of the major streaming platforms, French TV\u2019s fortunes have changed. If you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019ve likely seen Lupin, Call my Agent!, The Hook Up Plan, or Marseille. Netflix said that 70 million subscribers watched at least 2 minutes of Lupin within its first month on the platform. It\u2019s not just Netflix; \u201cThe Bureau,\u201d \u00c9ric Rochant\u2019s poignant spy series, is on Amazon, and it\u2019s become a global success, with several remakes in the works.\n\nThe quality of French television shows has gone up, while streaming platforms have \u201cplayed a major role in showcasing foreign series, boosting the appetite of global audiences for local shows, and maximizing their exposure around the world,\u201d Olivier Wotling, director of fiction for Arte, told Variety.\n\nNetflix especially has bet a lot into the French market. It is working on 20 new French series and movies, and just opened its first office in Paris. It\u2019s a good investment for the streaming service, which in a recent letter to shareholders (pdf) laid out a strategy of developing original foreign-language shows with wide appeal: As Adam Epstein reports, at least 87% of Lupin\u2018s viewers are not from France. (It\u2019s worth noting that many people are stuck at home, with more time on their hands to explore Netflix\u2019s catalog and take a chance on shows with subtitles.)\n\nNetflix\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this. When Netflix came to France in 2014, the industry \u201cfeared the streaming platform would squeeze out independent producers and disrupt the theatrical model around which the entire French film industry is built,\u201d as Nadia Neophytou recently wrote for Quartz. The low point came in 2017, when Netflix pulled out of the Cannes Film Festival after organizers said movies without theatrical release date wouldn\u2019t be eligible for awards.\n\nAnd yet, years later, it\u2019s clear the streaming platform has been key to the global success of French TV. Former French culture minister Franck Riester said as much during the launch of Netflix\u2019s Paris HQ in Jan. 2020 (link in French): \u201cBetween Netflix and France, it hasn\u2019t always been easy.

Here's how they can help or hinder your productivity and sanity.", "published": "Wed, 10 Feb 2021 16:14:56 +0000", "body": "Looking for creative ways to be more productive or productive exercises for boosting creativity? We have you covered.\n\nThis morning, after donning my most professional sweatshirt, I sat down prepared to focus on work.\n\nWithin an hour, my parents\u2019 retirement home called twice to discuss my father\u2019s health. As I returned to my computer screen, my reporter husband popped into my home office with an update about his latest story. Finally, I settled in again, but my dog pranced over to my chair and pawed at my knee\u2014she needed to go out.\n\nAnyone with young children, aging parents, roommates, friends, pets, or, you know, a personal life is familiar with these nano transitions, the moments during the workday when you briefly tilt away from work, often stepping into another role as a daughter, sibling, or confidante to a dear friend, or just to do something necessary for yourself.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t call these diversions nano transitions, of course. That term has only recently been coined by M. Gloria Gonz\u00e1lez-Morales, associate professor of psychology at Claremont Graduate University, along with Claremont graduate students, Megan Benzing, Alyssa Birnbaum, and Chloe Darlington. They propose that nano transitions are the natural extension of boundary theory, which gave us the concepts of macro transitions (retirement, job changes) and micro transitions (commuting), as key to understanding how people integrate life and work.\n\nThey have smart reasons for raising the profile of these short border-crossings now: with millions of people working from home in the wake of Covid-19, nano transitions can make or break your productivity\u2014and sanity.\n\nThrough interviews with people working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic, Gonz\u00e1lez-Morales\u2019 team discovered that nano transitions\u2014which are fluid and often fleeting\u2014are now occurring constantly, compared to what Gonz\u00e1lez-Morales calls our \u201cprevious normality.\u201d If the barrier between work and life was once as porous as swiss cheese, it has since become a fine mesh.\n\nBecause the researchers spoke to only 40 people for their in-depth qualitative interviews, they don\u2019t want to generalize to every remote worker. Still, readers might find their observations resonate with their own experiences.\n\nFor example, participants talked of toggling between desk work and laundry, or power napping between spreadsheets, or having dinner, then floating back to their laptops. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as delineated space and time\u201d for work, says Birnbaum. Now the workday is \u201cebbing and flowing\u201d around the clock.\n\nNano transitions have always existed, Gonz\u00e1lez-Morales says, but they were discouraged at most offices and therefore camouflaged as work or entirely hidden. Taking a moment to buy groceries or spending five minutes on Facebook because your brain needs relief from data analysis, these are tasks that would have been seen as counterproductive before the pandemic, says Gonz\u00e1lez-Morales, who is also an associate editor at Work & Stress journal.\n\nSure, maybe if you had special privileges in an office or held a senior position, you wouldn\u2019t need to disguise these moments away from the grind. But most people didn\u2019t want to be caught flaunting tacit rules about how to spend their time on the clock. If your brother phoned with questions about a family vacation, you answered him with your most formal, courteous voice, as if you might be talking to a client.\n\nGonz\u00e1lez-Morales predicts this kind of office theater will be consigned to pre-pandemic work history. \u201cSupervisors and managers, they need to understand that people have taken agency over their workflows and their work life,\u201d she says. They\u2019re not going to give it up when they go back to the office. Working from home productively \u201chas given them the idea that, \u2018Yeah, I can manage my work not based on who\u2019s watching or whether coworkers are there.\u2019\u201d So we need to understand how nano transitions operate, she says, and \u201cwe need to give these breaks legitimacy.\u201d\n\nNano transitions can boost your productivity\n\nNano transitions can be replenishing: Taking a tiny vacation from work that add up to create a greater sense of ease in your life. Knowing that you turned the oven on and started the prep work for dinner reduces your cognitive load. Spending five minutes with the sonic landscape of a national park or a meditative video can bring down stress levels. Walking is excellent exercise that can clear your mind and make space for a creative breakthrough.\n\nHowever, says Darlington, among their interviewees, some people were weaving life and work together like it was second nature, and others were struggling to manage their time and stay on top of work without the structure of an office routine. This was true in the early weeks of the pandemic and still true last fall, when the researchers conducted a second set of interviews. \u201cA finding that could have emerged was that people were saying, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m really doing much better than I was back in March in terms of managing my day.\u2019 But we didn\u2019t really find that,\u201d she says.\n\nDetailed interviews with the people who did feel recharged from nano transitions allowed Gonz\u00e1lez-Morales\u2019s team to develop a framework for optimizing the sudden fluidity with which life and work now mix. Nano transitions need AIR, they argue: they need to be autonomous, intentional, and regulated.\n\nBreaks that you don\u2019t autonomously schedule feel like interruptions, cutting into your flow and breaking your train of thought. \u201cIf you were in the office and [a manager] said, \u2018We\u2019re having an office party gathering that you all have to come to for this break,\u2019\u201d says Birnbaum, that can actually make the social event a chore.\n\nIntentional breaks are also more restful, compared to say responding to a text message and then \u201cmindlessly flipping into Facebook without realizing it,\u201d she adds.\u201d Finally, regulating your breaks prevents five consciously planned and purposeful minutes with TV news music choreography TikTok from turning into a lost hour with ostrich TikTok.\n\nWhen people were good regulators, the researchers learned, they could take long breaks and still get their work done. \u201cThe people that were [breaking] intentionally, sometimes for hours in the middle of their day, they\u2019d say \u2018I think it\u2019s really important right now to go do all my grocery shopping and hang out with a friend, and then I\u2019m going to push my work till night,\u2019\u201d Birnbaum explains. \u201cThat was actually working out for them versus the people that said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to start watching something and then it becomes two hours later, and then they\u2019re constantly filling in their work time, late at night or on the weekend, so work kind of became their life.\u201d\n\nAnyone who finds that nano transitioning routinely aggravates their stress levels may need to diagnose which of the AIR components they\u2019re missing. Take the interruptions to my morning. I could have made the most of those interruptions by choosing to turn them into something deliberate. \u201cIf you\u2019re at home and your partner comes out and interrupts you and asks you to do something,\u201d says Benzing, \u201cif you then decided, \u2018OK, well, now I\u2019m not working, so I\u2019m going to take a break now,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m already no longer paying attention now, I\u2019m going to do something else for a while,\u2019 it changes from being an interruption into something more similar to a nano transition,\u201d and it takes on the positive qualities of a break.\n\n\u201cOr you could also build a fence and say, \u2018No, you\u2019re interrupting me right now. Give me five minutes or ten minutes,\u201d says Gonz\u00e1lez-Morales. This approach can make the break more autonomous, too.\n\nThe professor hopes to drill down on the personality traits that make some people better nano transitioners in a future study. Perhaps some of us ought to default to blocking all nano transitions because taking multiple flash-breaks is a recipe for failure. Still, she says, \u201cThis is something that people can be trained to do as well. It can be supported by leaders and it can be modeled by leaders.\u201d\n\nTalking to your team about work breaks\n\nAnd it probably should be, too, because the social context for mini-breaks can also help or hinder their usefulness. Emotional reactions (including your own guilt or anxiety), the norms that develop around these transitions, and company culture all impact how well the breaks will work, the researchers suggest. If you feel uneasy exercising at lunch because you worry your teammates resent you for it, it\u2019s probably not going to be a relaxing break.\n\nIn many organizations, new norms are being established right now, whether mindfully or by happenstance, the researchers say. For example, one interviewee told them they could tell during an audio call that their boss was out walking during an important meeting, and it made them think to themselves, \u201cWell, I can do that too.\u201d\n\nInstead of leaving it up to employees to interpret norms, however, Gonz\u00e1lez-Morales recommends that managers establish that employees are indeed trusted to work, walk and talk, or nap as needed. Find out what people value, how their schedules work, and what time of day concentration comes easily.\n\nA conversation like that can shift the balance of power for those who still feel reluctant to finish an online grocery order, anyone fearful of new productivity-tracking software, and for the many whose nano transitions are controlling them, instead of the other way around.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bicycle-break-e1612879787494.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.991294264793396}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "They propose that nano transitions are the natural extension of boundary theory , which gave us the concepts of macro transitions ( retirement , job changes ) and micro transitions ( commuting ) , as key to understanding how people integrate life and work. \n\n Through interviews with people working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic , Gonz\u00e1lez - Morales \u2019 team discovered that nano transitions \u2014 which are fluid and often fleeting \u2014 are now occurring constantly , compared to what Gonz\u00e1lez - Morales calls our \u201c previous normality \u201d."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "ba434be6-fef0-4612-9786-46f4da543bdc", "source": "quartz", "data": {"title": "Buying bitcoin after an Elon Musk tweet is a perfectly rational move", "link": "https://qz.com/1971100/buying-bitcoin-after-an-elon-musk-tweet-is-a-rational-move/", "description": "If investors buy GameStop stocks after a Reddit-inspired rally or dogecoin after a Twitter frenzy, they are merely making the most of a clear signal in a confusing market.", "published": "Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:19:14 +0000", "body": "Capitalism is just a collection of human decisions. We can change it if we want to.\n\nGoing by the spate of recent commentary on the stock market, we\u2019re in the midst of silly season. People bought shares in a video game retail chain on the advice of anonymous Redditors. People are buying crypto because Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, tweets cryptic endorsements of it, or because his company has purchased $1.5 billion worth of it. This is all wild, irrational behavior, many pundits believe\u2014amateur investors showing their amateurishness. \u201cThis is just the sort of silliness we need to get used to at this stage of the longest market bull run in history,\u201d the Financial Times columnist Katie Martin wrote.\n\nInvestment gurus typically think of the rational retail investor as the kind of creature dreamed up by the economist Benjamin Graham. In his book \u201cThe Intelligent Investor,\u201d Graham advised his readers to look closely at annual reports, earnings announcements, and other financials. And certainly the history of markets tells us that there\u2019s plenty to be said for an approach based on such fundamental, careful scrutiny, even if it tends to be scorned during galloping bull runs like the present one.\n\nIt\u2019s also safe to say, though, that Graham\u2019s model is not the norm. Investors run short of time, or they know too little, or they listen to bad advice, or they\u2019re over-confident, or they fall prey to biases. They exhibit, in other words, what the economist John Maynard Keynes called \u201canimal spirits\u201d and what another economist, Herbert Simon, called \u201cbounded rationality.\u201d\n\nThe type of rational investing in which day traders buy stocks purely because they\u2019ve understood a company\u2019s fundamentals was rare even before GameStop and Musk. In fact, it\u2019s possible to argue that it\u2019s rare even among institutional investors today, given how much trading happens second-to-second, driven by algorithms that crunch vast streams of often unrelated data.\n\nBut what if there are other ways to be rational?\n\nTo many people, the stock markets must have been pretty confusing last year. Economies were suffering through the pandemic, and yet indices kept climbing. Alarmed calls of \u201cBubble!\u201d kept circulating, but nothing has, as yet, burst. The signals were difficult to interpret. In this mess of conflicting information, investors looked for clear signs of imminent movements in the prices of specific assets.\n\nThey found those signs on Reddit and Twitter. To be precise, they found signs of how other investors would behave in the short term. By now it\u2019s clear that when Musk hollers about an asset on Twitter, its value will rise. It has happened with Signal and GameStop; it has happened with dogecoin and bitcoin. The relationship between the tweet and the crowd\u2019s collective response may be irrational. But the individual investor\u2019s decision to anticipate that response\u2014and to anticipate at least a short-term rise in value\u2014is rational.\n\nOnce again, Keynes rides to the rescue. His \u201cbeauty contest\u201d thought experiment\u2014which supplied a way to think about when investors would sell their GameStop shares\u2014argues, in essence, that a smart investor will buy assets that others will also want to buy.\n\n\u201cThe fact that a thesis is flawed does not mean that we should not invest in it as long as other people believe in it,\u201d George Soros, a seasoned speculator who referred often to the Keynesian beauty contest, wrote in \u201cThe Alchemy of Finance.\u201d In other words, seeking out any clear cue to the crowd\u2019s behavior is also a rational thing to do, particularly in a perplexing market and amidst dizzying quantities of often-conflicting information.\n\nThe market is set up to reward that kind of approach as well, at least in the short term. That it does so even with Dogecoin, a joke cryptocurrency named after a meme dog, is a reflection not of the irrationality of the investor but of the caprice of the market itself.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/musk-e1612948511862.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.8539546728134155}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "People bought shares in a video game retail chain on the advice of anonymous Redditors.

The platforms said that the fake accounts were participating in \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior\u201d to target public discourse before the election.\n\nThe Uganda Communications Commission swiftly followed up by shutting down the internet, including all messaging apps and social media platforms, from Jan. 12. This ban provides insight into how authoritarian regimes are likely to wrestle with the power of social media companies: by simply shutting them out.\n\nThere is an inherent friction in having an authoritarian government running in parallel with an open, freely accessible internet. The initial wave of internet regulation in Africa mostly targeted users, with hate speech and misinformation laws as well as the imposition of digital taxes. The second wave of internet regulation laws is now targeting platforms by imposing demands.\n\nGiven the track record of how many African governments have regulated free speech, citizens should feel uncomfortable. It is clear that communications governing bodies will be content to increasingly exert their influence on citizens through internet shutdowns, as they continue to view social media through the same lens as they regard traditional media, even though the former is much harder to control.\n\nAside from shutdowns, platforms may be asked to set up local offices within countries to deal with legal demands to remove content, or host all data about citizens within the country of origin. The situation in Uganda paints a very vivid scenario of how authoritarianism will drive the rise of a splinternet on the African continent.\n\nBig tech meets big government\n\nThe drama unfolding in Uganda since its Jan. 14 election represents a unique escalation of tensions between an African government and big US tech firms. The debate as to what should and shouldn\u2019t be on social media platforms, and how content should be moderated, is front and center in the dispute.\n\nSince 2016, Facebook has worked with a global network of independent fact checkers to identify and reduce the spread of misinformation on its platform. This effort is is unsurprisingly clashing with authoritarian governments seeking to control the message.\n\nAfter Yoweri Museveni was declared the winner of the election, Facebook, through its fact-checking arm in Uganda, Pesacheck, mistakenly flagged a post by Kenya\u2019s president Uhuru Kenyatta congratulating Museveni as fake. Despite retracting the action, this was a critical misstep which played into the hands of the Ugandan government\u2019s narrative of social media companies\u2019 supposed arrogance.\n\nPesacheck\u2019s move was important in terms of increasing the transparency of fact checking to Facebook\u2019s users. Nevertheless, it highlighted a problem: Facebook has been ramping up its moderation and fact-checking efforts. What happens when it inevitably steps on the toes of African governments used to controlling the narrative? It\u2019s a problem that will likely see the rise of a very different internet from the one we\u2019re used to on the continent.\n\nWhether they like it or not, social media companies have amassed a tremendous amount of wealth and power in Africa. They are umpires of truth. When they subcontract tasks like moderation and fact-checking to contractors, that power is in effect shared with them. And wielding the power to decide what is true from what is false, as well as what people can and cannot see, is viewed by many as a political weapon.\n\nHow tech companies respond\n\nAfrican governments\u2019 attempts at regulating social media and the internet are a way of wrestling with this external editorial power; but it\u2019s a power their laws have a hard time addressing, particularly since the companies have barely any physical presence within their jurisdiction.\n\nTo this end, one can understand why the fashionable option for authoritarian governments around the world to curtail the power of privately owned platforms is to just shut down access completely. While internet services returned to Uganda on Jan. 18, the ban on social media remained until today (Feb. 10), with sites only accessible to Ugandans using unblocked Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). People using VPNs are regularly faced with threats of arrest. Internet shutdowns and social media bans are about wrestling back control.\n\nFor many who depend on these services, life got a lot harder. But the move comes at an expense for Uganda\u2019s government, given the economic cost of these types of shutdowns.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that the tech giants can turn to the US government for help, given how poor its diplomatic relations with Uganda are at present. The Ugandan government has accused the US of meddling in its affairs and subverting the will of the people. It has also equated Facebook\u2019s with US \u201carrogance,\u201d as president Museveni calls it.\n\nFor US platforms, it is not as simple as just walking away. Africa\u2019s population and internet usage growth make it an enormous market. And then there is the question of who will step into the breach. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if, in the future, we see trade deals involving an exchange of platforms over and above other goods and services. After all, China has long figured out censorship systems that authoritarian governments have shown a liking for. Moreover, Chinese cyber-diplomacy is already yielding results in Africa. Uganda already runs a robust surveillance system developed by Huawei that has been used to crackdown on dissent after anti-government protests.\n\nWe should remember that social media giants are for-profit companies and can\u2019t be relied on to push back on the governments of the day. Many platforms will hire people to say the right things. And fact-checking organizations and moderation contractors aren\u2019t devoid of political interests. Already Facebook has had to deal with political bias on the part of its moderators in the US.\n\nIt is possible that a splinternet will be the internet\u2019s inevitable fate, and that we face a future driven by authoritarianism, as opposed to democratic ideals, and exploitation as opposed to protection.\n\nBut how the balkanization of the internet will happen in Africa will depend on the type of content big tech allows to proliferate on its platforms just as much as what it keeps off. With more than 17 more elections planned in Africa this year, there are many more fights like the one we\u2019ve seen in Uganda are on their way. How the tech giants act today will have a huge influence on public discourse, the freedoms we hold dear, and the open internet at large. Democracy is at stake.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-01-17T125832Z_1801559814_RC2O9L9BB6YH_RTRMADP_3_UGANDA-ELECTION-e1612947002410.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9511772990226746}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "On Jan. 11 , Facebook and Twitter announced that they had taken down a network in Uganda , linked to the country \u2019s ministry for information , for posting using fake and duplicate accounts. \n\n The Uganda Communications Commission swiftly followed up by shutting down the internet , including all messaging apps and social media platforms , from Jan. 12."}, "category": "World"}, {"id": "5b172c72-8a3e-4d20-96b8-0165ff5db841", "source": "quartz", "data": {"title": "What India\u2019s most controversial ed-tech entrepreneur would do differently next time", "link": "https://qz.com/india/1968727/founder-karan-bajaj-on-whitehat-jr-ads-toxic-work-culture-claims/", "description": "\"I've grown a lot as a person in this whole startup experience.\"", "published": "Wed, 10 Feb 2021 05:53:22 +0000", "body": "Two-year-old coding-for-kids startup WhiteHat Jr became all the rage in India last year when it launched a multimillion-dollar advertising blitzkrieg, flooding television screens and digital media. It was hard to miss the commercials, some of which claimed the company\u2019s students\u2014some as young as six\u2014were being chased by global investors and bagging jobs at Google because of the skills they\u2019d acquired through WhiteHat Jr classes.\n\nThe campaign was a big success: WhiteHat Jr said its revenue run rate\u2014extrapolating an annual revenue figure based on one month\u2019s actual revenue\u2014ballooned from just $75 million (Rs546 crore) in June to $220 million in August. That same month, the company solidified its status as a startup success story when it was acquired by India\u2019s largest ed-tech unicorn, Byju\u2019s, for $300 million in cash.\n\nHowever, the very content that brought WhiteHat Jr to dizzying heights ultimately returned to haunt it. In October 2020, the Advertising Standard Council of India deemed some WhiteHat Jr\u2019s commercials \u201cmisleading\u201d and asked for them to be taken down. Then, the company that prided itself on creating jobs for hoards for educated women who weren\u2019t represented in India\u2019s workforce revealed toxic holes in its workplace culture.\n\nDespite the setbacks, WhiteHat Jr has kept its eye on the prize. The company is preparing to introduce multiple subjects and has international expansion on its mind. Yet, it\u2019s hard to ignore what happened with the company in 2020. So, Quartz took some accusations straight to CEO Karan Bajaj.\n\nBelow are the edited excerpts from the conversation:\n\nThe marketing mishap\n\nYour initial marketing placed an absurd amount of emphasis on employability for very young kids. What\u2019s your take on that now?\n\nI\u2019ve been very open in saying we should not have done it. But we also have to look at the relative proportionality of the data. We are talking about five or eight pieces of creatives an intern did among 900 pieces that are all about building things. When everything else in the marketplace was about prep and jobs, we went the other route\u2014about the kid\u2019s creative potential. The more kids become aware of tech right from the early days, they start to think of tech as a tool to build versus to consume.\n\nOverpriced, poorly structured courses\n\nSome believe the courses are overpriced, especially since much of the material is available for free on sites like code.org and Unacademy. What\u2019s your response?\n\nThat\u2019s like saying, there are books available so why do we need a school at all? Why do we have a teacher? It\u2019s comparing completely opposite delivery systems. We construct the entire curriculum on top of code.org, and we use Google DialogFlow and so many other software. The real value that\u2019s being added is both in the creation of the curriculum, as well as the teachers who are teaching it. All of it is completely our own innovative IP.\n\nUnder-qualified teachers\n\nThe company\u2019s ads even emphasise that teachers don\u2019t need any coding knowledge, and many do not have a background in coding. Are all your teachers qualified to teach coding to kids?\n\nWe have very clearly said that for grades 1-3, we need a very strong mathematical, logical backgrounds. We don\u2019t need coding syntax experience. They use block-based coding. (Picking from drop-down menus or drag-and-drop.) For grades 4-12, we go for coding backgrounds. Since 30% of our kids are in grades 1-3 and 70% in grades 4-12, 30% of our teachers have math and science backgrounds, and 70% have coding expertise.\n\nScripted classes\n\nTwo people who interviewed for teacher positions alleged the company gives under-qualified staff readymade scripts and if the student asks anything slightly out of the syllabus, teachers sometimes struggle to answer. Is it true that teachers are mugging up scripts to teach classes and aren\u2019t able to problem-solve in real-time?\n\nThere\u2019s a learning management system (LMS) for every teacher for each and every class. It\u2019s not like a marketplace where you can just come and take a class. We get about 10,000-12,000 applications a day. There is a phone recruitment process. And there is a first demo, a second demo, a third demo, and a fourth demo. After that, they have to go through a certification. And they have to go through all classes\u2014go through quizzes and variations of the code and clear the full certification. And for every class that a teacher takes on the platform, she has to go through the same exercises again. The LMS has like 13,000 hours of content overall.\n\nMisleading sales pitch\n\nSource A made up role.\n\nA former sales manager told Quartz that WhiteHat Jr encouraged her and her peers to use random designations (job titles), which should be authoritative, like director or co-founder. She used \u201chead of student operations\u201d (as shown in the e-mail screenshot). Does the company encourage employees to sell with false promises?\n\nThe idea is obviously to create a very ethical sales culture. And we put up all of the systems we can to do that. For sales, for example, a tool records every call, and misselling words have been put into the software. When you say things like \u201cdiscount\u201d when we don\u2019t give discounts, or somebody says \u201cwe have a tie-up with MIT\u201d\u2014we know these are common false promises\u2014that\u2019s fed into the system so that the moment a misleading word is used, there is an audit flag. We have a 17 member audit team. For any call that is flagged as a misselling call, there is an immediate audit is done and action taken. Misselling is a fireable offense.\n\nPoor work-life balance\n\nSeveral people Quartz spoke to said they had to log in for 14-17 hours each day, and were not given leaves for months on end. Are your employees overworked and deprived of leaves?\n\nWe have Darwin Box, which is an HR tool, where you log in and you log out the time. And that\u2019s an employee-led tool, not manager-led. We follow the shifts policy as laid by the government to the tee. Secondly, there is an anonymous HR help desk where you can email us.\n\nSomething that\u2019s not talked about, which we did very early in our journey, is employee counselling. We are a women-oriented company with 11,000 teachers and 40% of 5,000 non-teaching payroll employees also being female. All policies have been very well defined right from the start from POSH (prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace) to maternity. I would say, the work-life balance question is more about the ambiguity of the role rather than the number of hours. I think that experimentation plays more on people\u2019s minds because there are constant changes that happen in a startup trying to find the right model.\n\nNot so female-friendly?\n\nCurrent and former employees say the lack of women at the top is affecting the company\u2019s culture, security, and policies. A handful has complained of being subject to sexist remarks, derogatory comments, and racist overtones at the company. At least two people said they knew women who were denied the government-mandated six-month maternity leave. What do you have to say for critics of the work culture at WhiteHat Jr?\n\nIt\u2019s the law of numbers. If I was running a 10-person shop, finding three disgruntled employees would be difficult. With thousands of people, you can find three to create a false narrative. And this is the problem of hacking and putting things in the public. You can look at one out of 8,000 messages without knowing the action taken in that period itself. Systems are set up and actions have been taken already.\n\nLearning from past mistakes\n\nWhat has the biggest learning over the last year been for you?\n\nYou learn how to lead in a crisis. I\u2019ve grown a lot as a person in this whole startup experience. The fact of going from zero to a couple hundred million dollar company in 18-20 months very fast. A startup is very focussed at the beginning on product quality. My focus was very high on teacher quality, curriculum quality, student experience, and student operation. I think an equal focus should be paid on legal compliance, marketing, HR\u2014things at that point that are not burning fires. Next time I do a company, I would put equal emphasis on those right at the beginning.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-08-at-3.22.21-PM-e1612778068970.png?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9968555569648743}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Two - year - old coding - for - kids startup WhiteHat Jr became all the rage in India last year when it launched a multimillion - dollar advertising blitzkrieg , flooding television screens and digital media. \n\n The campaign was a big success : WhiteHat Jr said its revenue run rate \u2014 extrapolating an annual revenue figure based on one month \u2019s actual revenue \u2014 ballooned from just $ 75 million ( Rs546 crore ) in June to $ 220 million in August."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "d3437230-f740-4c54-bfa3-19b51f30c62d", "source": "quartz", "data": {"title": "Four huge new energy deals show the future of decarbonization", "link": "https://qz.com/1970530/4-huge-energy-deals-show-the-decarbonized-future-of-oil-and-gas/", "description": "While US oil companies stick with a fossil-centric business model, Chinese and European energy firms are making big renewable investments.", "published": "Tue, 09 Feb 2021 20:11:08 +0000", "body": "On Feb. 8, several of the world\u2019s biggest energy companies committed tens of billions of dollars to build out their vision for the next phase of the global energy transition. Although unconnected, the moves show that despite a general drop in spending because of the pandemic, some energy companies are willing to invest heavily to get big low-carbon projects moving ahead of their competitors.\n\nThe investments make four big trends clear.\n\nEuropean oil majors see their future in offshore wind\n\nIn the UK, the oil companies BP and Total emerged as the two top victors in a bidding war for an area set aside for offshore wind farm development. The two companies will each pay more than $1 billion to the UK to secure their claims, and plan to independently invest tens of billions of dollars building offshore wind turbines in the coming years.\n\nCompetition is heating up between European oil companies which see offshore wind as their best way to seize a lucrative slice of the growing market for zero-carbon electricity and leverage offshore operational skills from their drilling days. The UK bids follow at least two other big offshore wind deals this year: In January, Total announced plans to build one of the world\u2019s largest wind farms off the coast of Denmark, while BP won one of the biggest renewable energy deals in US history for an offshore wind farm in New York. Altogether, offshore wind projects in Europe drew a record $31.7 billion in investments in 2020; the market in the US is just beginning to open up.\n\nTech giants are key buyers of zero-carbon electricity\n\nTech companies are turning out to be critical early adopters of clean energy. In recent years, they have often been the first to step in as main customers for wind and solar projects in Asia, the US, and Europe. Dutch oil company Shell agreed to sell Amazon about half of the power generated by the giant new wind farm it\u2019s building in the North Sea. Amazon claims to be the world\u2019s top corporate purchaser of zero-carbon electricity, and the Shell deal will be its largest single project to date, equal to the output of about 6.5 coal-fired power plants. The electricity will mostly power Amazon\u2019s carbon-intensive data centers, putting it on track to run its operations exclusively on renewable power by 2025, five years earlier than originally planned, the company said \u2014 although for now, the company\u2019s overall carbon footprint is still rising.\n\nChina will defend its title as king of renewable energy\n\nBack on shore, Chinese solar firm Xinte Energy, a top producer of raw materials for solar panels, announced it is investing $2.5 billion in what will be the world\u2019s largest polysilicon factory. When the new facility becomes operational in a few years, it will boost the global supply of polysilicon by a third at a time when solar is the world\u2019s fastest-growing energy source. China is already responsible for more than 70% of global solar panel production, and is keen to defend its dominance after president Xi Jinping announced in December a goal for the country to source one-quarter of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2030. Investments like this will make it even harder for European and US solar companies to compete.\n\nTime is running out for countries exporting natural gas\n\nDespite all these announcements, rivers of money are also still flowing into fossil fuels. Qatar\u2019s state-owned oil company committed to spending $29 billion on a system of facilities to produce and export liquified natural gas. The project will be the largest liquified natural gas (LNG) operation ever built, according to the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie. It will also most likely be the largest single fossil fuel production project green-lit this year, for two reasons. First, most oil companies have slashed their budgets for exploration and production because of the pandemic, so big spending announcements will be rare. Second, Qatar is uniquely positioned to capitalize on what is likely the world\u2019s last fossil fuel gold rush: LNG exports, which a growing number of countries in Asia and Africa are turning to as a source of power that is less polluting than coal.\n\nGlobal LNG demand is growing quickly, but there are more export projects under development globally than even a rosy demand outlook requires. A race is on to snap up market share before it all gets eaten up by rivals. Qatar already produces much of the world\u2019s lowest-cost natural gas. The new investment will force public and private entities with planned LNG projects in Tanzania, Mexico, the US, and elsewhere to speed up or drop out. The new facility, likely to remain operational for decades, cements the fact that natural gas will be the hardest fossil fuel addiction for the global economy to shake.", "meta_img": "https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2019-04-25T070409Z_9018135_RC1ED159E370_RTRMADP_3_CHINA-ECONOMY-e1612900973912.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9993094801902771}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "European oil majors see their future in offshore wind \n\n In the UK , the oil companies BP and Total emerged as the two top victors in a bidding war for an area set aside for offshore wind farm development.

You have a tablet. But do you have a laptop that\u2019s kind of a tablet? If you want to combine the best of both worlds, there\u2019s plenty of flexible laptops out there capable of folding into a compact piece of tech. Take, for example, this 11.6\" Acer Chromebook. The laptop\u2019s touchscreen can flip around entirely, allowing you to turn it into a sort of standing tablet. That\u2019s perfect for watching movies or playing games without having a keyboard in your way. Other than that little perk, this Chromebook has 10 hours of battery life and 64 GB of storage. It\u2019s currently on sale for $220, so this is an inexpensive option for someone who needs a laptop but doesn\u2019t need the power (AKA, your mom).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosewill Mechanical Gaming Keyboard Graphic : Elizabeth Lanier\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI feel like there\u2019s something to using a mechanical keyboard with blue switches\u2014 something about that audible clack-clacking of the keys as I type makes me feel more productive. Plus, I just prefer using a mechanical keyboard when gaming.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a new mechanical keyboard, you gotta check out one of today\u2019s Shell Shocker deals over at Newegg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight now, you can snag a Rosewill mechanical gaming keyboard for just $50. That\u2019s half-off from retail and cheaper than you can even find it on Amazon. Plus, just look how bright and shiny its RGB lighting is\u2014 don\u2019t you want that on your desk?! You can even adjust it to one of 22 different backlighting pre-programmed modes.\n\nSince this keyboard has Blue Kailh switches rather than Brown Kailh switches, expect the audible clicks as you type, as I mentioned earlier. This keyboard ships for free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresidents\u2019 Day Video Game Sale Screenshot : Nintendo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlright, let\u2019s get something straight. Presidents\u2019 Day? Whatever! It seems like a pretty lame holiday and you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find anyone that \u201ccelebrates\u201d it. But is having a day off from work nice? Yes. And is having a bunch of absolutely random sales because of it also a perk? Yep. So, it\u2019s hard for me to complain when Best Buy is running a massive video game sale for the holiday. What\u2019s discounted? Too much to list here considering there are 12 pages of deals. But here are some highlights none the less. First-party Nintendo Switch games are discounted across the board, and you know how rare that can be. Most notable is the elusive Ring Fit Adventure, which is down to $70. Even the rarely discounted Animal Crossing: New Horizons is down to $50. The Last of Us Part 2 is $30, so you can finally form an opinion on it for half price. The absolutely fantastic Yakuza: Like a Dragon is down to $40 and I can\u2019t recommend it highly enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuy 2 Get 1 Free Sale Image : Giovanni Colantonio\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s few things I like more than a good buy two get one free gaming sale. As a physical media faithful, it\u2019s an easy way to restock my shelves. Amazon has a B2G1 running right now, which actually includes books, movies, and more as well. You can mix and match if you\u2019d like, but if you\u2019re here for the games, here\u2019s a few recommendations so you don\u2019t have to dig through six pages. First and foremost, yes, Cyberpunk 2077 is included. Both the console versions (proceed with caution there) or the PC version are eligible for the sale. If you\u2019re a Duty Head, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is included as well. PS4 owners can grab Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man, which is one of the best games of last generation. My main man Tony Hawk is even included here. That\u2019s only a small collection of what\u2019s included, so peak through the full list if you\u2019re interested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nG/O Media may get a commission Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 - PlayStation 4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMario Special Edition Nintendo Switch Image : Nintendo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider this a fair warning: the Super Mario Nintendo Switch is now on sale, and it\u2019s going to go fast. Every time Nintendo releases a new special Switch, listings are up and down within seconds. GameStop is already sold out and we imagine other retailers won\u2019t have it much longer. By the time you\u2019re reading this, it may even be sold out at Target, where you can currently get it. So if you want one, don\u2019t delay. This special Switch is all red and blue, just like the most famous Italian himself. In addition to a custom color scheme, the package comes with a Switch carrying case too, which is a nice bonus. If you were going to buy a Switch at some point anyways, you might as well go this route and get the extra perk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all knew this day was coming. Ever since Cyberpunk 2077 launched just in December, it\u2019s seemed pretty clear that a price drop was imminent. A wave of bad press really hurt the game\u2019s word of mouth, despite the fact that it reportedly sold over 13 million units.\n\nWhether or not this is directly related to all of the fallout, you can now get Cyberpunk 2077 on PlayStation 4 for $44 or Xbox One for $45 from Amazon. If you\u2019d rather get a PC copy, Eneba has the game down to $27 when you use the discount code CP2027 at checkout. You\u2019ll get a key that\u2019s redeemable on GOG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBe warned that the game has been widely criticized on consoles for poor performance, especially if you have the original base PS4 or Xbox One hardware (instead of the PS4 Pro or Xbox One X).\n\nCD Projekt Red has announced a roadmap of patches and fixes that will finish rolling out this month, and you\u2019ll also get access to the respective next-generation upgrade on PS5 or Xbox Series X/S once that\u2019s released later this year. However, there is no guarantee of eventual performance quality, so jump in at your own risk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve seen Ubisoft slash the price on games like Watch Dogs: Legion, Just Dance 2021, and even Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, but the studio just took things to another level. You can now grab Immortals: Fenyx Rising for $30 at Amazon. The game is still relatively brand new, so that\u2019s about as fast a price cut as you can expect. Ubisoft\u2019s latest open world game looks like it takes many cues from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, with free climbing, gliding, and rune-like abilities that can be used to solve puzzle shrines. Except it\u2019s about Gods. If that sounds up your alley, you can grab the PS4, Xbox, and Switch versions at a discount now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDigimon Digivices Image : Giovanni Colantonio\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you clicked on this article because of the headline, congratulations: you are a real one.

Now that we all agree that these digital monsters are the champions, you can buy Digivices for $12 at GameStop today. These 90s throwbacks are essentially Tamagotchi for digiheads. Feed your Digimon. Train your Digimon. Teach your Digimon to commit tax fraud. Attend your Digimon\u2019s wedding. Watch your Digimon grow old enough that it has to take care of you. Be buried by your Digimon. Watch down from Heaven as your Digimon thrives as a functioning adult with a six figure job in hotel management.

This Beboncool set has two batteries and their charger, and it falls down to $17 at Amazon.\n\nThe batteries are rated for 2,550mAh capacity, which should get you more than 15 hours of playtime, and it only takes a couple of hours to recharge them once they\u2019re depleted. This is my preferred alternative to plug-and-play kits, as it means I never have to stay attached to the \u2018box.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDead Cells Prisoner\u2019s Edition (Switch) Screenshot : Motion Twin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA new year means new opportunities to drop money on crazy gaming collector\u2019s items with no regard for your wallet. I\u2019m usually immune to it, but even I\u2019ve been succumbing recently, buying steelbooks and special editions. This special physical version of Dead Cells is really tempting me to take it to the next level though. The Switch version of the roguelike\u2019s Prisoner\u2019s Edition is down to $80 on Amazon and it\u2019s stacked with extras. It includes a 8.5\" statue of the game\u2019s protagonist and a 7\" vinyl soundtrack. That game\u2019s got jams, so the latter is especially appealing. A DLC code for the Bad Seed DLC is included too, and the entire thing is housed in a snazzy metal tin. So I need this? No. But do I deserve a damn reward for surviving 2020? I\u2019d argue yes for the purposes of making a crazy purchase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s been a quiet year for games so far, and that\u2019s likely to continue considering how many delays have already happened in 2021. But there\u2019s actually a neat little gem coming this week: Little Nightmares II. The first game was a wonderful, creepy puzzle platformer that got a little lost in the 2017 shuffle. With the runway clearer, the sequel looks like it\u2019ll make a bigger impact with its dazzling art direction that makes it look like the second coming of Limbo. The game is out today and you can currently get the PS4 version for $25, the Xbox version for $27 (with promo code EMCESHH49) and the Switch version for $34. I have no idea why they are all slightly different prices, but that feels properly horrifying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nG/O Media may get a commission Little Nightmares 2 (Xbox) Buy for $27 from Newegg Use the promo code EMCESHH49\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEA Games Sale (PC) Screenshot : EA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever thought about buying any EA game in the past few years, here\u2019s your moment to shine. Amazon is running a giant EA publisher sale, which includes discounts on some of the company\u2019s greatest hits on PC only. If you don\u2019t want to subscribe to EA Play, this is an excellent chance to pick and choose the games you want for cheap. The sale includes a mix of recent hits and golden oldies. If you\u2019ve been thinking about getting Star Wars Squadrons, it\u2019s on sale for $24. Speaking of the space drama, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is only $20.\n\nThe deals don\u2019t stop there! Want to dip into Burnout Paradise Remastered? That\u2019s only $5! There are some rock bottom prices on amazing games in here, like Titanfall 2 for $6 or Dead Space for $2, so browse around and see if there\u2019s anything you\u2019ve been meaning to pick up over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Game of the Year Edition (Xbox) Screenshot : CD Projekt Red\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCyberpunk 2077's launch has been one of the messiest in recent memory. While some are enjoying CD Projekt Red\u2019s ambitious open world game, others are experiencing a wave of bugs and graphical errors that make immersion next to impossible. The last-gen editions of the game are in especially bad shape, leaving fans to wonder if the studio actively tried to hide the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions ahead of release. The situation is so bad that Sony pulled the game from the PlayStation store entirely, leaving CDPR scrambling for fixes. Oh, and there\u2019s that whole cyberattack drama as well, which is unfortunate.\n\nAll that said, it\u2019s not really a great time to buy Cyberpunk 2077 if you\u2019re a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One owner. Hell, I played on PC and it still felt like it wasn\u2019t quite ready. So here\u2019s a something to do while you wait for the next big patch: get The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Game of the Year Edition for $10 instead. For those who have yet to play it, it\u2019s a much better introduction to CD Projekt Red and its ability to craft sprawling open world adventures. If you like it, come back to Cyberpunk later this month when the game\u2019s second massive patch is supposed to launch. Or maybe wait until the Complete Edition inevitably drops in a few years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1 Year EA Play (PS4) MOSTLYSPORTS Image : EA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s a fun fact about sports games: they tend to be the last games released on older consoles. For whatever reason, gamers who just play Madden or FIFA don\u2019t seem to care about upgrading to a new machine right away. They\u2019re happy to just keep their old system as long as the next annual edition of their favorite sports games keep coming to it. With that in mind, here\u2019s a perfect deal for that specific type of gamer. You can get one year of EA Play on PS4 for $26. Just use the code MOSTLYSPORTS at checkout and you\u2019ll shave a few bucks off the usual price. This may seem niche, but we\u2019ve got to look out for all kinds of gamers here.

Just as a heads up, we previously had a discount code for the white model which brought it all the way down to $10\u2014 but that was a very short-lived deal that didn\u2019t last through the day. So, this may drop again in price, but the black model is the best bet for now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis deal was originally published by Elizabeth Lanier on 1/31/2021 and was updated with new information on 2/13/2021.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInsignia 5-qt.

Available in Developer\u2019s Kit RED and Prototype variants, it might seem concerning that neither of these sounds like a finished product, but naming isn\u2019t everything. While the company probably should have steered clear of monikers that, in the tech world, are typically synonymous with \u201cworks in progress,\u201d both F1s models are nevertheless pretty advanced pieces of equipment. Too advanced, some might argue.\n\nBut for the horny desk jockey, it\u2019s also kind of hard to resist a male sex toy that hooks up to your phone using a smartphone app for unbridled customization. But imagine if, on top of being able to control your settings and track performance, you were also able to modify the SDK yourself.

Lelo\u2019s entire line is made from the plushest ultra-silicone, softer than any vibe in my collection. The Soraya 2 was designed to be the perfect shape because Lelo literally did trans-vaginal ultrasounds to engineer the most elite vibrator on the market. If that\u2019s not dedication, I don\u2019t know what is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know I\u2019m a sucker for sex tech, and I was positively surprised by the ingenuity of the Soraya 2. Lelo really took into consideration a woman\u2019s body and needs. There are twelve vibration settings, and it\u2019s effortless to operate with the button placement and the open handle. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s \u201cwhisper quiet,\u201d but it\u2019s a lot gentler in the noise department than other toys out there. It absolutely holds its charge and can handle self-love sessions for up to two hours. You also can only use one motor at a time because the dual ones are independent of each other. Which I have to say is a nice feature to mix it up. The Soraya 2 is extremely accomodating, and if you\u2019re looking for something with a kick, this might be the vibe for you. This is approved for watersports, so don\u2019t be afraid to take it on a high seas adventure. Water-based lube is recommended. And please remember to clean your goodies before and after use. Lelo actually has a great spray for that.\n\nThis will ship for free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuy 2 Get 1 Free Media Sale Image : Andrew Hayward\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a fresh batch of media to help get you through the rest of the pandemic-intensified winter, you\u2019re in luck: Amazon is holding a huge Buy 2 Get 1 Free sale on physical media, which includes movies and TV shows.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lot included in the promotion.

Photo : Christopher Furlong ( Getty Images )\n\nThe covid-19 vaccination effort is finally achieving liftoff in the U.S. In the days since we highlighted the case for optimism about the pandemic ending, data collected by Bloomberg shows 2 million more Americans have received a shot.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. is outpacing most European countries in terms of doses given per 100 people. Looking at the Bloomberg map, though, shows an even starker discrepancy. The African continent is nearly blank, as are large parts of Latin America and Central and Southeast Asia. Vaccine contracts similarly reveal a huge chasm\u2014in the U.S., there are enough vaccines purchased to inoculate 199% of the population. Canada and the UK are above 300%. In contrast, many African countries are in the single digits. This uneven distribution is creating what Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of UNAids and United Nations under-secretary general, has called \u201ca global vaccine apartheid,\u201d and it\u2019s a lesson of what the climate crisis holds if the Global North hordes the solutions.\n\nLike the climate crisis, the pandemic has exposed the chasms that exist between the haves and have nots. At the national level in the U.S., it\u2019s resulted in Black, brown, and Indigenous Americans dying at higher rates than the overall population. While mostly white office workers are able to work safely from home, those working in low-wage jobs like factory workers, meat-packing plants, and delivery drivers have been exposed to the virus and forced to fight for protections. The vaccine rollout in the U.S. has followed similar patterns, and the injustice is even sharper at the global level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight now, demand for covid-19 vaccines is outstripping supply. But as a Bureau of Investigative Journalism dive into the global data shows, uneven vaccine distribution due to rich countries\u2019 wealth, clout, and funding into vaccine development could end up setting the world back. Developed countries have also paid less for the vaccine than developing ones, in some cases; the Bureau for Investigative Journalism found Uganda paid $7 per dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, triple the EU\u2019s price tag. It\u2019s the equivalent of comping a celebrity\u2019s meal at a restaurant while forcing someone living paycheck-to-paycheck to cover the difference on their bill.\n\nThe reasons for more equitable vaccine distribution are manifold. There\u2019s a prevailing idea that once the U.S., for example, is vaccinated to the point where it reaches herd immunity, things can go back to something approaching normal life. But as we\u2019ve seen, the coronavirus doesn\u2019t respect borders. The longer coronavirus circulates in other countries, the more the risk of mutations that vaccines may not ward off could rise. That\u2019s already on display with the South African variant, which appears able to sneak past the AstraZeneca vaccine\u2019s defenses (though illness appears to be less severe when it does) .\n\nG/O Media may get a commission Up To 85% Off Lelo Valentine's Day Sale Click Here To Have Your Mind Blown\n\nGet discounts on vibrators, rings, and cutting-edge sex tech now through the end of the week.\n\nBeyond that, there\u2019s also a very real risk that the pandemic continuing in countries far from rich countries\u2019 borders could still wreak havoc on their economies. The world is not just connected by air travel, it\u2019s connected by commerce. Economic slowdowns in countries where the virus surges could travel up the supply chain and slow the economy down in countries where herd immunity has been reached.\n\nCovax, a global effort for rich countries to fund vaccine distribution in poorer countries, is poised to help somewhat by providing vaccines for 20% of registered countries\u2019 populations. But there is a strong international case to more equitably distribute the various approved covid-19 vaccines even more equitably, as well as a case for regulators to relax patents on the vaccines so production can be ramped up for the world\u2019s sake. Wealthy countries could donate excess vaccine doses to Covax or through other means, though few have laid out plans or a timetable to do that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey may want to consider all these avenues for their own sake; a paper modeling a cooperative, global vaccine distribution strategy where countries receive doses relative to their population size shows doing so would result in 61% fewer deaths globally. Deciding who\u2019s grandma or emergency room physician gets vaccinated\u2014and who potentially dies as a result of not being vaccinated\u2014is fraught, and I do not envy decision-makers having to make those choices and explaining them to the public. But there\u2019s a strong argument for countries working together rather than trying to get theirs.\n\nThe struggle to operate under that paradigm with the clear and present danger of the pandemic is a worrisome sign as the world pivots to addressing the climate crisis. The whole reason the climate crisis exists is that wealthy countries have spent decades burning fossil fuels with abandon at the expense of worsening climate shocks at home and abroad. The impacts of decisions made in those decades will also reverberate throughout this century as the climate tries to find a new equilibrium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same is also true of the decisions we collectively make today. Turning off the dirty fuel that\u2019s driving the climate crisis is only one aspect of a much bigger shift needed. Just as important is figuring out how to divide up the emissions we can relatively safely put in the atmosphere in the coming decades. Rich countries have emitted much more than their fair share of emissions. It\u2019s what enabled them to become rich countries in the first place.\n\nWhen it comes to decarbonizing, a just plan would see wealthy countries take on the burden of leading the way and providing technical know-how to less developed ones. Since we can\u2019t grow the allowable-emissions pie without inviting disaster, it would also give those countries a greater share of what pie is left.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, the changes we have already locked in are going to literally reshape the world as we know it. Even under a best-case scenario where the world keeps warming to the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, millions of people will still be forced to migrate because of drought, extreme heat, or sea level rise. Arable land would shrink in regions like the edge of the Sahara, upending livelihoods. Extreme events like the major hurricanes that battered Central America last year would become more common.\n\nWealthy countries can build all the sea walls or install all the air conditioners running on wind power they want. At the end of the day, they\u2019ll also need to find a way to help countries with fewer resources do the same, both because it is the moral thing to do, but also because of the same reasons they should be finding a way to get more vaccines to places in need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider the Syrian civil war, which a climate change-driven drought helped spark. It destabilized an entire country, led to the rise of ISIS, and created a refugee crisis that has fueled the far-right and anti-immigrant sentiment across Europe. While aid to drought-stricken farmers alone wouldn\u2019t necessarily have curbed Syrian President Bashir al-Assad\u2019s atrocities, the ongoing war, death, and destabilization of the past decade is what awaits if the world does not become more democratic and cooperative.", "meta_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/tbr8t1dpafp8ihoohp4g.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.99233478307724}, "keywords": ["Vaccine", "Environment", "Health", "Medical", "Pharma", "COVAX", "World Health Organization", "COVID-19", "G20", "Health sciences", "Medicine", "Clinical trials", "Medical research", "Articles", "COVID-19 vaccine", "Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator", "Earther"], "summary": "The U.S. is outpacing most European countries in terms of doses given per 100 people.

If someone who\u2019s really jonesing for some office space happens to pick a locale that isn\u2019t near one of the 48 different Spotify offices across more than a dozen countries, than the company will set them up with a membership for a coworking space somewhere nearby . That said, this isn\u2019t permission to jet off just anywhere in the world\u2014Spotify notes in its announcement that there are \u201csome limitations\u201d on where employees can go, just because of \u201ctime zone difficulties, and regional entity laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal of our new design approach is to ensure that employees have a place where they can focus, collaborate, and create\u2014whether that\u2019s at a desk, in a conference room, or in cafe spaces,\u201d Spotify\u2019s post explains.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission Up To 85% Off Lelo Valentine's Day Sale Click Here To Have Your Mind Blown\n\nGet discounts on vibrators, rings, and cutting-edge sex tech now through the end of the week.\n\nIn explaining its rationale behind the new program, the company added that its employees\u2019 effectiveness \u201c can\u2019t be measured by the number of hours people spend in an office,\u201d and that \u201cwork isn\u2019t something our people come to the office for, it\u2019s something they do.\u201d\n\nWhile not every industry is able to offer this kind of flexibility, the tech sector has embraced the WFH lifestyle over the course of the pandemic. Earlier this week, for example, the cloud giant Salesforce announced a similar policy change to Spotify\u2019s, giving its tens of thousands of employees the option to stay fully remote, fully in-office, or a mix of the two. This comes on the heels of other companies like Shopify, Twitter, and Square giving their employees the option to continue working remotely for as long as they\u2019d prefer, even after their offices eventually reopen. There\u2019s even an ongoing crowdsourced Github project tracking the constantly updating list of tech companies giving their employees the chance to work from home permanently.

Prev Next View All\n\nIt\u2019s called bipartisanship: Both major political parties have some bad ideas for reforming Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the foundational internet law that shields websites from lawsuits over user-generated content or their moderation decisions.\n\nDemocrats in the Senate have introduced the \u201cSAFE TECH Act,\u201d which would expose website operators to greater legal liability on issues like ad fraud, stalking, and harassment, as well as clarify that companies like Facebook are not immune to foreign lawsuits for enabling war crimes or genocide. It\u2019s well-intentioned but has numerous flaws, including overly broad language that could hold virtually any company that takes payments online legally liable for the actions of their customers and inflict massive collateral damage on the web. Other provisions could bog down website operators in frivolous lawsuits over moderation decisions, like racists suing to get their accounts back.\n\nRepublicans aren\u2019t in a position to push any kind of bill through Congress right now, but they haven\u2019t disappointed with the asinine proposals. GOPers have continued their long-running attacks on Section 230 and kept pushing legally nonsensical reforms to punish tech companies for supposedly discriminating against conservatives. But Sen. Ron Johnson took the cake in late January by bucking his party\u2019s direction and instead called for an end to anonymity online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot : Twitter\n\nNever mind the Constitution or anything! Christ.\n\nIt\u2019s been a hot minute since our last edition of Hellfeed, so here\u2019s your rundown of some of the biggest developments of the last few weeks.\n\n\n\nG/O Media may get a commission Up To 85% Off Lelo Valentine's Day Sale Click Here To Have Your Mind Blown\n\nGet discounts on vibrators, rings, and cutting-edge sex tech now through the end of the week.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Oversight Board issues first rulings\n\nIn case you missed it, Facebook has become a little controversial lately\u2014you know, over little things like serving as a vector for conspiracy theories and massive disinformation campaigns, hateful propaganda, and election interference, not to mention enabling at least one genocide\u2014and discussions over its moderation choices have become a tad bit... heated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo it set up an Oversight Board, a supposedly independent court of academics, legal experts, politicians, and civil rights activists that depending on who you ask is either designed to whitewash Facebook\u2019s decisions or a Pandora\u2019s Box potentially outside the company\u2019s control. In late January, it issued its first five decisions on matters ranging from a post in Myanmar taken down as hate speech to a post with a quote attributed to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. In four out of five cases, the Oversight Board ruled against Facebook\u2019s mods.\n\nFacebook isn\u2019t just one of the world\u2019s richest companies, but one of its biggest communications networks. That puts the Oversight Board in the awkward position of being seen as competing for legitimacy with norms and laws on speech that vary significantly from nation to nation (and, obviously, within them). Whether this is yet another step towards corporate dystopia, an overblown debate about policies at one company, or just Facebook pomp and circumstance, at least one of its upcoming decisions will have major ramifications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe board is now debating whether to restore Donald Trump\u2019s ability to post after he incited the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol, and it\u2019s entirely possible the board will decide to let him back on. Republicans who have long relied on a strategy of playing the refs are taking it seriously. According to the New Yorker, conservative groups lobbied the company in May 2020 in an attempt to stuff the Oversight Board with right-wing mouthpieces, and Trump personally called Mark Zuckerberg to complain about its choice of members.\n\nOne important factor here is research showing that a relative handful of accounts with huge followings are disproportionately successful at spreading lies and disinformation\u2014such as conservatives pushing Stop the Steal, the election fraud conspiracy theory that ultimately culminated in the Capitol riots. Other research has shown that rather than bubbling up through grassroots posts by random users, election disinformation was primarily spread via an organized propaganda campaign waged by Trump, his political allies, and the right-wing media and amplified via traditional mass media. Twitter\u2019s post-riot ban wave against Trump and his sycophants resulted in an immediately noticeable drop in hoax claims of election fraud, early research found. Finally, for all the talk of Trump\u2019s Twitter account, his Facebook megaphone may have been as or even more important.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is all to say that if the Oversight Board rules in favor of Trump, Facebook is going to have a real mess on its hands. A decision isn\u2019t expected for weeks or months.\n\nIn the meantime...\n\nTwitter isn\u2019t bothering with the red tape and has reiterated that Trump is permanently banned, forever, even if he somehow becomes president again, and with no recourse to appeal to a panel of wonks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump is reportedly spending a lot of his time writing out insults on paper and asking remaining staffers to tweet them for him. Let\u2019s move on, shall we?\n\nParler will be up any day now... yep... any day now... just you wait\n\nParler, the right-wing Facebook clone where many Trump supporters issued death threats against members of Congress while organizing and later livestreaming the Capitol riots, was driven offline last month after Amazon Web Services canceled its hosting contract and Google and Apple removed its app from their respective stores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts executives, such as former NRATV blowhard Dan Bongino, have continually insisted that Parler will return any day now. It hasn\u2019t, but it did fire CEO John Matze in some kind of feckless internal power struggle and is now facing a House Oversight Committee investigation of whether it tried to literally bribe Trump into joining.\n\nInfluencers are horrible\n\nInstagram celebrities in Dubai are behind a gargantuan underground network in abusive animal smuggling, per a report by Bellingcat that is worth a read:\n\nThe use of social media platforms to trade in exotic animals, and the dangers of \u2018cub-petting\u2019 industries, are well-documented. But the direct link of celebrities and influencers to these practices is not. By posing with lion and tiger cubs and tagging these accounts, celebrities advertise a network engaged in the online trade in exotic animals to millions of followers. Some of these animals are brought out for photo shoots several times a month when still young, and end up being kept as a pet in private homes. Apart from potential legal issues and the well-being of the animals themselves, the trade in exotic animals puts already threatened wildlife populations at risk of poaching.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGamestonks\n\nThere may soon be multiple movies in development about r/WallStreetBets, the Reddit board that realized the power of crowds to carry out the same kind of reckless financial engineering done by hedge funds every day and deployed it to impressive effect over a couple of weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPosters on r/WallStreetBets organized to pump up the stocks of several ailing or unimpressive companies, like Gamestop and BlackBerry, in an effort to fleece short-sellers that had placed major bets against those companies. Other major Wall Street players quickly realized what was happening and got in on the resulting speculative frenzy, with GameStop shares peaking at $483 before promptly crashing and other targeted companies following a similar pattern. For reasons that are simultaneously incredibly stupid, very predictable, and partially due to Elon Musk, completely unrelated things like joke cryptocurrency Dogecoin got pumped, too.\n\nThe fiasco spelled disaster for stock-trading app Robinhood and is now the focus of a vaguely threatening Securities and Exchange Commission investigation focusing on market manipulation. But while it took everyone by surprise, it\u2019s not exactly unprecedented. Stock-pumping efforts on online message boards have been around for over two decades, and it\u2019s not like major Wall Street firms aren\u2019t in the business of screwing with the economy to turn a quick buck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTikTok, WeChat to probably be just fine\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s administration has asked courts to halt Trump\u2019s orders threatening to essentially blacklist TikTok, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance, and Chinese messaging app WeChat from U.S. app stores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo recap, last year the Trump admin ordered TikTok to sell off either a controlling or major stake to a U.S. or be put on Commerce Department blacklists. It mostly justified this with babble about national security risks and censorship, but it was clear that the White House\u2019s real interest was taking hostages in the U.S.-China trade war and shaking down a Chinese company to look tough on communism (and the leading contender for the coerced deal conveniently happened to be Trump\u2019s cronies at Oracle). The WeChat ban was purely punitive and would have cut off millions of Americans of Chinese heritage and expats from their relatives abroad.\n\nThis whole scheme fell apart as the elections approached and it became clear Trump was not going to remain in office, and there\u2019s never been any real expectation that Biden was particularly interested in pursuing it. It\u2019s hanging in the air for now, but it seems pretty unlikely that the apps are safe for now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter is rebranding itself\n\nPerhaps eager to rebrand after the last four years (and under pressure following a failed shareholder revolt led by hedge fund goons last year), Twitter is rapidly rolling out new features and considering changing its business model. That includes an Instagram stories knockoff, buying out a Substack competitor in a pivot to monetized newsletters, the introduction of a weird community-operated fact-checking platform, and an audio chat feature cloning snobby Silicon Valley app Clubhouse. (Facebook is also cloning Clubhouse.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis week, news came around that Twitter is considering offering premium features via paid subscriptions and allowing users to tip each other in cash.\n\nInstagram threatens to sue the hell out of OGUsers\n\nAccording to Vice News, Instagram has taken the unusual step of announcing it has publicly identified pseudonymous members of OGUsers, a group of cybercriminals that hack, extort, and scam their way into controlling accounts with millions of followers. The company said it has issued cease and desist orders to the people in question, threatening lawsuits if they do not comply and provide additional information on possible co-conspirators.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetritus of the week\n\nIf social media has made you sick in the head, please take the time to hoot and holler at this ridiculous article on the Federalist asserting that Snapchat Discover is poisoning our precious youth\u2019s minds with shows about polyamory and witchcraft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ban list", "meta_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/b4qbujjf2nhwregletnk.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9541053771972656}, "keywords": ["Parler", "Software", "TikTok", "Facebook", "Mobile applications", "Conservatism in the United States", "Operating systems", "Universal Windows Platform apps", "WeChat", "Video software", "Alt-tech", "Computing", "Gizmodo"], "summary": "Democrats in the Senate have introduced the \u201c SAFE TECH Act , \u201d which would expose website operators to greater legal liability on issues like ad fraud , stalking , and harassment , as well as clarify that companies like Facebook are not immune to foreign lawsuits for enabling war crimes or genocide.

Image : Disney+/Marvel\n\nAs WandaVision\u2019s been carefully dropping nostalgic breadcrumbs along the winding narrative path leading to grandmother\u2019s house where the truth lives, the show\u2019s been playing not-so-subtle tricks of the mind meant to make you wonder who the villain of it all truly is. All signs up to this point have pointed to Wanda herself being the culprit, but that answer\u2019s always seemed too easy, and \u201cAll-New Halloween Spooktacular!\u201d certainly raised a few more questions\n\nAfter the surprising cameo and dramatic changes to WandaVision\u2019s cast made in \u201cOn A Very Special Episode...\u201d, episode six feels very much like the series\u2019 in-universe show attempting to run away from the present day reality butting up against the Hex surrounding Westview. With the instability of Westview\u2019s localized reality now being squarely on SWORD\u2019s radar, Wanda\u2019s picture-perfect fantasy\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to maintain for different reasons that aren\u2019t all that clear.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause \u201cAll-New Halloween Spooktacular!\u201d was set to shift WandaVision\u2019s show-within-a-show to the \u201890s/early \u201800s, the series\u2019 creative team had more than a few options to choose from for which actual TV sitcom it would channel in order to get a few digs in at the medium. The riff on Malcolm in the Middle elevates Billy (Julian Hillard) and Tommy (Jett Klyne) from just being Wanda and Vision\u2019s inexplicably conjured twin sons to being markedly conscious in ways that nobody else in Westview is\u2014save for their father.\n\nG/O Media may get a commission Up To 85% Off Lelo Valentine's Day Sale Click Here To Have Your Mind Blown\n\nGet discounts on vibrators, rings, and cutting-edge sex tech now through the end of the week.\n\nBefore the episode properly kicks into gear, we spend a few moments fleshing out the boys\u2019 personalities with a flashback to them playing Dance Dance Revolution before they get ready to go trick-or-treating in the present. In Marvel\u2019s comics, the former Young Avengers Wiccan and Speed are considered Wanda\u2019s (and to a lesser extent, Vision\u2019s) spiritual children\u2014they\u2019re not...technically the exact same beings the couple wished into being back in the \u201880s. Beyond Pietro joking about them being hellspawn, there\u2019s still time for WandaVision to get into the whole mess of Billy and Tommy being pieces of a demon\u2019s soul who\u2019ll one day be reincarnated as \u201cnormal\u201d children born to unsuspecting parents, the show keeps things simple and instead nods to that potential future by having Billy dress up in a DIY version of his original costume.\n\nThere were a few other minute details, like intentional winks and nods to meta-details about both the characters and actors in the show, this week as well. Tommy teasing his brother about being a \u201cdorkasaurus rex\u201d feels vaguely like the show having a chuckle at Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson\u2019s roles in Garth Edwards\u2019 2014 Godzilla, which also starred Malcolm In the Middle\u2019s Bryan Cranston, for example. Wanda also happens to enter the episode sporting a riff on her classic comics costume, as does Vision, in the guise of Halloween festivities. Jokes like this become particularly dense whenever WandaVision\u2019s focus turns to the newest MCU Pietro\u2014now being portrayed by Fox\u2019s X-Men films actor Evan Peters\u2014who the boys both implicitly understand is one of the stranger people currently living in their town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVision, Pietro, and Wanda. Image : Disney+/Marvel\n\nMuch like the adolescent twins who repeatedly break the fourth wall in ways that nod to Malcolm and hint at their being extensions of Wanda\u2019s mind, Pietro also appears to be much more in on the Westview act than most of the other adults who encounter her. One of the more curious things about WandaVision\u2019s Pietro here, is how his deep knowledge about Wanda\u2019s past directly clashes with both what we as an audience know about them as characters, and what Wanda knows about him as her twin brother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough this Pietro does have his signature superspeed, WandaVision keeps it in the style of how it was used the MCU rather than the more visually impressive way it was shot in Fox\u2019s X-Men films. This could all simply be because Fox\u2019s superspeed works better as visual set pieces rather than as a superpower within a sitcom, but the way Wanda keeps finding moments alone with Pietro to discuss the off-ness they feel about him being there makes it feel as if there\u2019s certainly more to him than meets the eye. After Pietro has a flashback to him and Wanda as children in Sokovia, she uneasily points out that she doesn\u2019t recall things playing out quite like that. His reasoning that her memory\u2019s been affected by trauma gives her enough pause to make it obvious that the statement hit her, but she\u2019s still in the thrall of \u201cthe show\u201d enough to let the moment pass without comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVision shares some of his sons\u2019 apprehensions about their uncle because while he may not recognize Pietro, he does know that the Sokovian\u2019s meant to be dead in the ground. Beyond that, the synthezoid clearly still recalls Wanda rolling the credits over him in the middle of their fight, and no level of denial from her makes him believe she isn\u2019t the cause of Pietro\u2019s resurrection. When Vision is wearing his comics-nod of a Halloween costume, he markedly notes that he does so not by choice but because where was nothing else in his wardrobe\u2014 and while he\u2019s still able to play along for the sake of...well, it\u2019s not clear who he\u2019s doing it for, he makes clear to Wanda that he still thinks she\u2019s manipulating him. To Vision\u2019s credit, Wanda does come close to chastising Vision for breaking character when he tells her that he plans to check in with the neighborhood watch, which isn\u2019t what the \u201cepisode\u201d has in mind. But in Wanda\u2019s defense, she doesn\u2019t exactly try to stop him, even though she presumably could, and the episode does start to give you more reason to suspect that she isn\u2019t exactly lying when she says that she\u2019s not in control.\n\nBy the time that Pietro\u2019s grabbed Tommy\u2019s hand and zoomed away only to return within nanoseconds sporting his own version of Quicksilver\u2019s comics costume (with Tommy sporting a miniature one) \u201cAll-New Halloween Spooktacular!\u201d establishes that, uneasy as things are with Vision and Wanda, the family does all still genuinely care about one another. The story\u2019s somewhat different outside the Hex where SWORD\u2019s still reeling from having its ass handed to it by Wanda in the previous episode.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPietro telling Wanda he knows that he looks a little different. Screenshot : Disney+/Marvel\n\nAs Hayward, Monica, Darcy, and Jimmy regroup in a tent, it\u2019s interesting to see that the drone Wanda destroyed is still charged with her energy even though she\u2019s nowhere near the object (in the past we\u2019ve never seen her powers linger quite like that). While Hayward\u2019s now focused on how to take her out, Monica, Darcy, and Jimmy all feel that SWORD\u2019s best plan of action would be to continue observing and looking at the situation as a rescue mission. Hayward\u2019s heel turn\u2019s far from surprising, but his very pointed question about whether Darcy and Monica\u2019s \u201csassy best friend\u201d in the group is as scathing as it is ugly. You can interpret it as a dig at Monica herself, but also at Wanda for hexing Monica into that sort of archetype in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHayward\u2019s insistence on eliminating Wanda is very much in line with the long history of human military types in genre fiction deciding to shoot first and ask questions later. But because where the series has been headed as of late, though, both Wanda\u2019s Magneto-like talk with SWORD and Hayward\u2019s response bears a resemblance to the kinds of stories that have been featured prominently in the X-Men franchise. As Monica points out the potential dangers that might arise were Wanda to die, Hayward finally does what neither Jimmy nor Darcy felt comfortable doing in the last episode: he explicitly brings Carol Danvers into the conversation to make a point.\n\nIt\u2019s always interesting to hear \u201cnormal\u201d people within the MCU talk about what the superheroes are up to because, often, they\u2019re the characters who remind the audience of how world-changing events leave people on the ground justifiably scared of those with superpowers. Hayward reasons that Monica\u2019s personal connection to Danvers is one of the reasons she insists on advocating for superhumans, something he believes is in conflict with SWORD\u2019s primary directive. Of course, if you\u2019ve seen Captain Marvel, then you understand how deeply incorrect Monica\u2019s mother Maria might consider Hayward\u2019s perspective, and his jabs do feel personal and meant to hurt Monica emotionally. But it must be said, we as an audience and Monica don\u2019t really know whether time, Carol\u2019s absence, and other events within the MCU changed Maria\u2019s outlook on life, and Hayward isn\u2019t entirely incorrect. While Monica means wells, people like Wanda and Carol\u2014empowered by Infinity Stones\u2014are beings that humanity has reasons to be concerned about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonica\u2019s righteous insubordination leads to her, Darcy, and Jimmy\u2019s dismissal from the entire project and as a result, being firmly put in a position to become even more heroic within the series. The show establishes this with Monica and Jimmy making the snap decision to knock out some goons, steal their outfits, and steal info from SWORD to help them break back into the Hex. But \u201cAll-New Halloween Spooktacular!\u201d further complicates things in a fascinating way with yet another hint that Monica\u2019s exposure to the mysterious space has left her changed in ways that she hasn\u2019t realized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHidden within SWORD\u2019s files that Darcy breaks into are classified details of Monica\u2019s bloodwork that show how being pulled into and thrown out of the Hex meant having her entire physical form rearranged multiple times. Previously, WandaVision revealed Monica\u2019s body no longer shows up properly on scans, and the computer screens we see in this episode give you brief glimpses of molecules within her now radiating a strange glow. This all feels like a pretense for the emergence of Monica\u2019s classic Spectrum powers which would be a very cool addition to the MCU.\n\nBut the fact that all of this is coming as a result of second-hand contact with an Infinity Stone is yet another reason to wonder whether WandaVision is trying to tease out the birth of the MCU\u2019s mutants. Were the odd things going on with Monica\u2019s DNA the result of her specifically coming into contact with Wanda, that would be one thing. If merely being touched by the Hex and infused with some of its energy is key to unlocking abilities hidden within people\u2019s DNA, however, there could be a future in which the MCU inverts M-Day and turns Wanda into the mother of mutant-kind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the time being, though, Wanda\u2019s mainly concerned with her life in Westview as she, Pietro, and the twins wander through the town taking in everyone\u2019s costumes and talking about the many elephants in the room. In addition to gesturing towards the existence of Kick-Ass\u2014the comic book-turned-film series that starred both Peters and Taylor-Johnson\u2014Wanda and Pietro admit to one another that they don\u2019t get why his face looks different, though Pietro at least understands why she\u2019d want to avoid addressing his death in her suburban paradise. The way he talks to her about the dark truths of their lives is both casual and frank, and gives you the impression that he\u2019s a cool uncle who...knows that he\u2019s supposed to be dead, but very much wants to be there for his younger sister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPietro also wants to be there for his nephews, who delight in the fact that he makes little attempt to hide his powers, perhaps because most people can\u2019t tell when he\u2019s using them. It\u2019s also worth noting that Pietro\u2019s apparently able to \u201cshare\u201d whatever it is about him that allows him to move so quickly by holding hands with Billy and Tommy as they run around grabbing candy and messing up people\u2019s lawns. The Maximoff boys\u2019 high-speed shenanigans could very well be Wanda\u2019s subconscious projecting the deceased Pietro\u2019s abilities into her imagined family, but this week\u2019s plot challenges this idea by showing you a bit more about how the Hex actually functions.\n\nBetween the credits, the scene breaking, and her brief visit to the outside world, WandaVision\u2019s given us all every reason to assume Wanda\u2019s a mastermind within Westview who at the very least is subconsciously manipulating everyone within the Hex at all times. Vision even being able to wander away from Wanda and survey the rest of the town could easily be something that\u2019s only possible because he told her that he planned to be away at the top of the episode. When \u201cAll-New Halloween Spooktacular!\u201d cuts to Vision, you see that while there\u2019s more and more activity the closer one gets to Wanda, people closer to the Hex\u2019s edge appear to be in a kind of waking rest state, idling as they wait to be given reason to talk. It\u2019s legitimately haunting to see the cluster of light and activity coming from Westview\u2019s town center starkly contrasted by the darkness and quiet Vision sees as he flies into the air after realizing that the people on the outskirts of town can\u2019t really interact with him. Strange as it all is, a bright light shining next to a home with glowing red windows catches the synthezoid\u2019s eye, and it brings him face to face with Agnes, also on pause, in her car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPietro appearing dead to Wanda. Screenshot : Disney+/Marvel\n\nAt the same time that Vision unlocks Agnes\u2019 suppressed personality the way he did with Norm in the last episode, Wanda and Pietro are continuing their discussion about his being alive, and the husband and wife pair both make alarming discoveries that give them reason to be scared. Vision cannot comprehend what an Avenger is when Agnes, confusedly explains to him that he used to be one before dying, but he does process Agnes\u2019 warning that Wanda won\u2019t even let her think about escaping the Hex. When Wanda questions Pietro what happened to her accent, he responds in kind with the same, which is funny because fans have been wondering what happened to Wanda\u2019s accent for years, but unsettling because Wanda can\u2019t answer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven more disconcerting, Pietro fully recalls being shot to death during the events of Age of Ultron, and he explains to Wanda that, after dying, he heard her calling out to him wherever he was, and he came running. He makes light of these truths by wrapping them all up in the language of TV storytelling where the manchild uncles roll into town to shake things up, and WandaVision\u2019s in-universe show drains some of the tension of out the moment by bringing the twins back into the picture and revealing that Tommy\u2019s developed his own superspeed independent of his need to touch Pietro.\n\nRather than letting the show\u2019s sitcom logic fully take over, though, we stick with Pietro and Wanda as the two of them keep dropping any pretense with one another and go into detail about what Wanda\u2019s done. When Pietro first changes into his Quicksilver costume, his ridiculously windswept hairdo reads as WandaVision trying to go for as much comics accuracy as possible. But Pietro marveling at the sheer number of children finally milling about in Westview makes it much easier to consider whether Pietro\u2019s hair tufts bearing a resemblance to a demon\u2019s horns is intentional. Their conversation about kids is strange because it was Westview\u2019s lack of children that was one of the topics of Wanda and Vision\u2019s most recent fight, and the way Pietro talks to his sister makes it seem as if he\u2019s impressed that she rose to the challenge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Wanda directly asks Pietro whether he thinks the things she\u2019s actually responsible for are morally objectionable, he points out that the changes were made with some sort of ethical considerations in mind. Pietro\u2019s assertion that she\u2019s making things better by adjusting reality slightly comes across as WandaVision\u2019s reminder of the pieces of House of M\u2019s story at play here. Wanda\u2019s insistence that she doesn\u2019t know how the Hex began reads as authentic, as does the horror in her face when she sees a brief glimpse of Pietro, dead-eyed and riddled with bullet holes. Also eyebrow-raising is the way Wanda suddenly turns on Pietro later in the episode when he jokes that she doesn\u2019t need to be concerned about Vision dying again considering that she can apparently bring him back from the dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe loneliness and emptiness Wanda describes as the only things she can recall before Westview sound a lot like the feeling coursing through Westview\u2019s other residents when they\u2019re freed from Wanda\u2019s influence, again implying that Wanda might not be wholly to blame. Before WandaVision lets you sit with all of this for too long, the episode begins to come to a close by pivoting to Vision as he breaches the Hex\u2019s outer walls and comes face to face with SWORD, Hayward, and a captured Darcy. Up until this point, all we really knew about Vision\u2019s resurrection was that Wanda needed his corpse for some reason before she was able to magic it back to life. As Vision tears out of the Hex, though, you see that whatever it is that\u2019s sustaining him is more than just a replacement for the destroyed Mind Stone. It\u2019s extremely difficult for him to break free of the Hex, or even stand once he\u2019s outside it, and not just because his power source is missing. We can\u2019t be clear of the cause yet but you see chunks of Vision\u2019s vibranium body being ripped apart as the Hex attempts to suck him back in.\n\nBilly using his powers to stop Tommy. Screenshot : Disney+/Marvel\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is clear, though, is that the experience is agonizing for Vision and awful to see first hand. It\u2019s seemingly the pain of being outside the Hex that activates Billy\u2019s burgeoning, and unsurprisingly ill-defined, powers to jump out as he forces Tommy to stop running with a raised hand, and begins clairvoyantly zeroing in on their father\u2019s location. The way Wanda only springs into action once her sons alert her to the emergency is another reason to suspect that they might be parts of her subconscious designed to keep her focused on her family, but what she does in response to Vision being in trouble overshadows almost everything else about \u201cAll-New Halloween Spooktacular!\u201d\n\nEvery piece of evidence supporting the idea of Wanda\u2019s innocence becomes infinitely less convincing as her pupils dilate and go completely red before everything inside of Westview slows and a massive wave of energy explodes from her body. Monica calling the Hex a self-imposed quarantine earlier in the season was strange at the time, but her words prove to be eerily prescient as the Hex begins to expand. It not only envelopes and restores Vision, but warps an even larger chunk of the world along with it. The show of the Hex sweeping outside of town limits to transform the surrounding area into more Westview is one of WandaVision\u2019s most striking visual sequences yet. It immediately evokes echoes of the snap from Avengers: Endgame, though here the change leaves everyone quite alive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its final moments, WandaVision leaves even more questions unanswered than when the episode began, but what seems painfully obvious now is that, regardless of who\u2019s responsible, there\u2019s no way that the world\u2019s not going to know about the Westview anomaly and who\u2019s causing it. What started off as a strange occurrence only airing on local public access TV is quickly becoming a massive event that people are going to be forced to at the very least watch, if not become active participants in. It\u2019s the sort of wild event that could easily draw headlines and lead to the public developing a very particular set of bigoted beliefs about anyone left changed by the Hex. It all makes you wonder \u201cWhat If?\u201d But that\u2019s probably a question better left for another time.\n\nWandaVision is now airing on Disney+.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more, make sure you\u2019re following us on our Instagram @io9dotcom.", "meta_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/uo1e81lj19j6uizsbaiz.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9992579221725464}, "keywords": ["WandaVision", "Scarlet Witch", "Wiccan", "Speed", "Wanda", "Tommy Jett Klyne", "Billy", "Monica Rambeau", "Wanda Group", "Quicksilver", "Pietro", "Vision", "Wanda Maximoff", "Fictional characters", "Fiction", "io9"], "summary": "Wanda Maximoff as a Sokovian fortune teller. \n\n\n\n Advertisement \n\n Because \u201c All - New Halloween Spooktacular ! \u201d."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "d6981042-0c41-45ea-a2ef-7092b0605227", "source": "gizmodo", "data": {"title": "I Can't Believe I Actually Like the Alexa Shower Speaker", "link": "https://gizmodo.com/i-cant-believe-i-actually-like-the-alexa-shower-speaker-1846252966", "description": "I\u2019m well aware that inviting Alexa\u2014and therefore Amazon\u2014into my shower is possibly a bad idea.

So when I say installing this thing is so easy that even a disaster-prone klutz can do it, you should believe me. All you have to do is unscrew your current showerhead and screw this one on. That\u2019s it! Pairing the device to your phone is also easy\u2014it\u2019s the same process as pairing any other Bluetooth speaker, though you can also go through the Kohler Konnect app. (I didn\u2019t find the app itself added much to the experience.)\n\nThe speaker\u2019s sound quality was also pretty good, which in retrospect shouldn\u2019t have been super surprising as it\u2019s the result of a partnership with Harman Kardon. It wasn\u2019t as good as, say, my Sonos Move, but all my music sounded great because it was in the shower with me and I never had to worry about it falling off the wall. My old shower speaker of choice was the UE Wonderboom 2 and while it was simple to use, I had to crank the volume fairly high to clearly hear my music over the water. It also required me to waddle out of the shower, dripping water everywhere, to rifle through my phone\u2019s playlist if I wanted to skip a track. I\u2019ve also tried using the HomePod as my bathroom speaker and more often than not, my voice is too muffled for Siri to correctly hear my requests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI didn\u2019t have that problem with the Moxie.\n\nSmart Home Smart Speakers Smart Home Smart Speakers Kohler Moxie Showerhead + Wireless Speaker Kohler Moxie Showerhead + Wireless Speaker What is it? A showerhead with a smart Alexa-enabled wireless speaker Price $200 Like Good sound quality. Easy to install. Alexa in the shower is surprisingly convenient. No Like Buttons hard to reach.

Sometimes it struggled with less common names\u2014I\u2019ve yet to find a digital assistant that identifies Mitski correctly 100% of the time\u2014but for the most part, Alexa got the job done. It was also nice that I could ask what events were on my calendar or opt for a little news update. That said, I do occasionally feel weird that perhaps some Amazon stooge is listening to me in the shower. On those days, even though I find Alexa convenient, I opt to connect to my phone manually. However, if it creeps you out entirely, know you can use this speaker without ever having to enable Alexa at all.\n\n\n\nMy one major gripe is that the power, mute, and volume buttons are not the easiest to use. The Moxie is designed in such a way that the squarish speaker component attaches magnetically in the center of an outer, ring-shaped showerhead. The control buttons are on the sides of the speaker, but when attached to the showerhead, they\u2019re both hard to see and reach\u2014especially if you\u2019re short and have bad vision like me. Technically, you can pop the speaker out as it\u2019s got an IPX7 water resistance rating, but I instinctually never wanted to do that once the shower was already running. (You never know!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto : Victoria Song/Gizmodo\n\nAnother frustrating thing was battery life. I often forgot to turn off the speaker when I was done. While it does shut off automatically after a while, I got the sense my forgetfulness really ate into the estimated 9-hour battery life. More than a few times, my husband and I came to the shower ready to jam only to find the speaker was dead. (This, however, could easily not be an issue if you\u2019re more diligent about turning the speaker off and checking battery levels.) The Moxie comes with a small charging cradle, which is easy enough to use but sort of annoying in a small bathroom if you don\u2019t have enough counter or cabinet space to store it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDesign-wise, the Moxie is sleek and inoffensive. Our review unit was the black version, which didn\u2019t necessarily fit our bathroom\u2019s decor, but I didn\u2019t mind so much as it actually improved our water flow. Our old showerhead was...old and leaky and the Moxie felt as close to a rainfall showerhead as I was going to get outside of a fancy hotel stay. One thing to note, however, is if you want a shower head that gives you multiple spray modes, this ain\u2019t it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt $200, this is the priciest showerhead that I, a cheapskate, have ever used. If all you\u2019re looking for is better water pressure or something with a longer reach, you can find far more affordable options at Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s. Likewise, you can find a ton of waterproof Bluetooth shower speakers in the $30-$50 range. It\u2019s very easy to both upgrade your showerhead and get a decent shower speaker for under $100. But if you\u2019re willing to splurge just a little bit, or can split the cost with roommates/a significant other? The Kohler Moxie is actually a convenient way to get a nicer showerhead and a good quality shower speaker in one easily installed package.", "meta_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/i64mvqcyesdaxhv4c4lz.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9851251244544983}, "keywords": ["Alexa", "Shower", "Bathrooms", "Euthenics", "Academic disciplines", "Hygiene", "Bathing", "Amazon Alexa", "Wireless speaker", "Technology", "Plumbing", "Gizmodo"], "summary": "Smart Home Smart Speakers Smart Home Smart Speakers Kohler Moxie Showerhead + Wireless Speaker Kohler Moxie Showerhead + Wireless Speaker What is it ?.

View Deal\n\nThe team then planned to do a close approach and analyze the rock with Yutu 2's Visible and Near-infrared Imaging Spectrometer (VNIS) instrument, which detects light that is scattered or reflected off materials to reveal their makeup.\n\nVNIS has been used to investigate a number of rocks and regolith samples along Yutu 2's path across Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n crater. These include unusual melt glass specimens and potentially material from the lunar mantle .\n\nWhile not looking particularly exciting to the untrained eye, the find has generated interest among lunar scientists. \"It seems to have a shard-like shape and is sticking out of the ground. That's definitely unusual,\" Dan Moriarty, NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, told Space.com.\n\n\"Repeated impacts, stresses from thermal cycling, and other forms of weathering on the lunar surface would all tend to break down rocks into more-or-less 'spherical' shapes, given enough time,\" Moriarty said. \"Think of how rocky beaches wear down stones to smooth, round shapes over time by repeated jostling in the waves.\"\n\nMoriarty said both the shard-like shape and that pronounced \"ridge\" running near the edge of the rock seem to indicate that this rock is geologically young, and was emplaced relatively recently.\n\nRelated: Yutu 2 snaps stunning new panoramas from the moon's far side\n\nImage 1 of 3 A navigation camera image of the elongated \"milestone\" rock spotted on the far side of the moon by China's Yutu 2 rover.

It is possible that a rock with this aspect ratio could have been produced by a process known as spallation, where intact fragments of rock are blown off the nearby surface without experiencing the same degree of shock pressures that the immediate target undergoes,\" Moriarty said, adding that this initial assessment is just a guess.\n\nFollowup detections and data from VNIS will provide much greater insight. Clive Neal, a leading lunar expert at the University of Notre Dame, agrees that, based on the images, the specimens are impact ejecta rather than exposed bedrocks. \"The question I have is are they locally derived? Hopefully the spectral data will allow an evaluation of the origin as local or exotic, that is, from outside this area,\" he said.\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: CNSA) Image 2 of 3 (Image credit: CNSA) Image 3 of 3 (Image credit: CNSA)\n\nYutu 2 and the Chang'e 4 lander have already greatly exceeded their design lifetimes of 90 Earth days and one year, respectively.

We already have a number of inside jokes and we've only been on Mars together for just over 24 hours. Most crews end up choosing a certain theme for their mission inspired by pop culture, such as \"Die Hard\" for Valoria 1 and \" The Mandalorian \" for SENSORIA M3.

This involved trying to find different parts of our body and balancing on one leg, both with our eyes closed. Everyone seemed to be very nervous about failing this test, especially in front of the whole crew. That is why one of the funniest moments today was when one crewmember exclaimed, \"We all found our thumbs. Biggest achievement of the mission so far!\"\n\nWe progressed to much more difficult tasks once Lain determined that we should all be able to do a handstand by the end of the mission. They involved positions that we refer to as \"cats making pizza\" and \"bananas.\" This resulted in more laughter, alternating closely with nervous giggles and sweat as we tried more and more challenging tasks. Everyone tried very hard to improve their flexibility and successfully performed an assisted headstand. We are now both terrified and excited about what will await us tomorrow as part of this training.\n\nPlant Biology Officer Paul Tomko taking care of lettuce grown in the LettuceGrow hydroponics system at HI-SEAS.

Thanks to his study, we are now all curious to see whether we are fully aware of how we interact with others, since the Amazon Halo app and wrist device is meant to detect our tone of voice, amongst other features.

Much remains a mystery about how galaxies formed in the early universe and how they evolved mature features such as rotating disks and central bulges of tightly packed stars. To peer that far back in time, astronomers need to look at light from distant galaxies, but such targets are often too dim to see well.\n\nIn the new study, researchers focused on the galaxy ALESS 073.1,. The starlight they detected from this galaxy came from 12.5 billion years ago, when \"the universe was 1.2 billion years old, about 10% of its current age,\" study lead author Federico Lelli, an astrophysicist at Cardiff University in Wales, told Space.com.\n\nRelated: Scientists think they've spotted the farthest galaxy in the universe\n\nUsing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, the scientists analyzed high-quality images they successfully collected of ALESS 073.1's dust and gas. They used this data to model how matter was concentrated in the galaxy and calculate its motions.\n\nUnexpectedly, the researchers discovered the galaxy possessed both a rotating disk and a central bulge. They also found signs it may even possess the same kind of spiral arms that mature galaxies such as the Milky Way have extending from their cores.\n\n\"This galaxy looks like a grown adult, but it should just be a little child,\" Lelli said.\n\nALESS 073.1's core also generated more energy than can be explained by stars. Prior work has suggested that such an \"active galactic nucleus\" (AGN) hints at the presence of a supermassive black hole millions to billions of times the mass of the sun.\n\nPreviously, researchers thought central bulges formed slowly over time, due to gravitational instabilities within a galaxy, or mergers between galaxies. \"ALESS 073.1, instead, was able to form a big bulge, making up about half of its stars, in less than 1.2 billion years,\" Lelli said. \"This young galaxy appears surprisingly mature.\"\n\nThis map shows the motion of gas in the galaxy ALESS 073.1. Gas shown in blue is moving toward us, while the gas shown in red is moving away from us, which suggests the galaxy is rotating. (Image credit: Federico Lelli)\n\nEarlier research also suggested that galaxies forming in the primordial universe are generally expected to be chaotic, turbulent and largely unstructured because of all the activity they are going through, such as devouring gas from their surroundings and forming stars at very high rates. The orderly structure detected within ALESS 073.1 \"is at odds with these expectations,\" Lelli said.\n\nThese new findings suggest that galaxies can form mature features such as disks and bulges far more quickly and efficiently than previously thought. \"Structures like bulges, regular rotating disks, and possibly spiral arms must form in less than one billion years, which is a tall order for current models of galaxy formation,\" Lelli said.\n\nIn the future, the scientists aim to collect similar high-quality images for a dozen or so more galaxies from the same cosmic epoch, Lelli said.\n\n\"These new observations will establish whether galaxies like ALESS 073.1 are the rule or the exception in the primordial universe,\" Lelli said. \"The observations were supposed to take place last year, but unfortunately the ALMA observatory was shut down due the COVID-19 emergency.\"\n\nThe scientists detailed their findings in the Feb. 12 issue of the journal Science.\n\nOriginally published on Space.com.", "meta_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/owiJ78JQw4pRKzArpZUFJF-1200-80.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9876959919929504}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "Gas and dust ( shown in blue and red , respectively ) in the galaxy ALESS 073.1 observed when the universe was only 1.2 billion years old. \n\n In the new study , researchers focused on the galaxy ALESS 073.1 ,."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "e5e20d53-f73b-4591-a8aa-44651ff5e532", "source": "space.com", "data": {"title": "'For All Mankind: Time Capsule' AR app augments alt space history series", "link": "https://www.space.com/for-all-mankind-show-augmented-reality-app", "description": "A new augmented reality app serves as a bridge between the first and second seasons of the Apple TV+ alternate history series \"For All Mankind.\"", "published": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 23:25:41 +0000", "body": "\u201cFor All Mankind: Time Capsule,\" a new augmented reality (AR) experience based on the Apple TV+ alternate space history series, is now available from the Apple App Store.\n\nA new augmented reality app serves as a bridge between the first and second seasons of \"For All Mankind,\" the Apple TV+ alternate space history series that explores what might have changed if the Soviets were the first to put a person on the moon.\n\nIn \" For All Mankind: Time Capsule ,\" now available through the Apple App Store , users can piece through a virtual box of personal mementos belonging to Danny Stevens (played by Casey Johnson), the son of astronauts Gordo and Tracy Stevens (Michael Dorman and Sarah Jones).

The Higgs boson doesn't live very long, quickly decaying into less massive particles like two photons (light particles).\n\nNow, researchers using ATLAS and CMS at CERN's Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland have found evidence for a rare Higgs boson decay in which the subatomic particle decays into one photon and two leptons, a type of elementary particle that can be charged or neutral. (Electrons and muons, a similar type of subatomic particle, are two examples of charged leptons.)

View Deal\n\nUsing the Standard Model, scientists are able to predict the different elementary particles that the Higgs boson can decay into, with a fairly \"common\" decay being two photons. They can also estimate how often the Higgs boson decays into different combinations of particles, and it is particularly rare for the Higgs boson to decay into a photon and two leptons.\n\nIn this type of decay, after its uber-short life, the Higgs boson quickly turns into one photon and what scientists call a \"virtual photon.\" That \"virtual photon,\" also known as an \"off-shell photon\" then immediately turns into something like, in this case, two leptons. This \"virtual photon,\" has a very small non-zero mass, while regular photons are completely massless, James Beacham, a particle physicist with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, told Space.com.\n\nIn a new study, researchers working with the Large Hadron Collider found the first evidence for a rare Higgs boson decay. (Image credit: CERN)\n\nThe two leptons \"hit our calorimeter really close to each other,\" Beacham added. The LHC's calorimeter is a tool that stops particles coming from a particle collision. Scientists can spot and study these particles when they're stopped or \"absorbed\" by the tool.\n\nWhile scientists have predicted that this type of decay should exist with the Higgs boson, this new detection is \"the first hint of evidence of this very rare decay mode of the Higgs boson,\" Beacham said.\n\nHowever, he added, the team likely won't be able to directly observe the rare decay until they upgrade the facilities for the upcoming High-Luminosity LHC program (which will come following the LHC Run 3. The data used for this study was collected during Run 2, the second running period for the collider that began in 2015 and ended in 2018. Run 3 will begin in March, 2022.)\n\n\"With vast amounts of data expected from the High-Luminosity LHC programme , studying rare Higgs boson decays will become the new norm,\" according to a statement from ATLAS .\n\nBy studying rare decays like this, researchers can explore the possibility of new physics that stretches beyond the Standard Model. The Standard Model explains a lot of things about our physical universe, but it doesn't include gravity or dark matter, Beacham said. Dark matter , which emits no light and cannot be directly observed, is thought to make up about 80% of all matter in the known universe, but scientists do not yet know exactly what it is.\n\n\"We're always looking for extensions to the Standard Model,\" he said. \"We have to find a window or a portal from our world into this dark sector world and play experimentally. And one of these could be the Higgs boson.\" Beacham explained that the \"dark sector\" encompasses physics that extends beyond the Standard Model.\n\nNow, don't get too excited. This paper \"does not give us new information yet about the Higgs portal into the 'dark sector,'\" Beacham said. But \"this paper proves that we can look for very rare things like this, quite handily,\" he said, which pushes the search forward overall.\n\nThis work was presented at a public LHC seminar at CERN Feb. 1 and you can see it on CERN's website. The document published by CERN is a CONF note, which is an ATLAS preliminary result.\n\nEmail Chelsea Gohd at cgohd@space.com or follow her on Twitter @chelsea_gohd.

The Mars rover landed on the Red Planet on Jan. 4, 2004 for three-month mission to look for signs of past water activity on Mars, and found extensive evidence over many years. Ground controllers lost communication with Spirit in March 2010, and repeated attempts to awaken the rover failed. The rover far outlived its intended warranty, and is considered a success. NASA declared Spirit dead in May 2011.\n\nMars Exploration Rover Opportunity: U.S., launched July 7, 2003. The Mars rover landed on Jan. 25, 2004 for a three-month prime mission in the Meridiani Planum region. The rover has logged more than 20 miles on the Red Planet and was eventually felled by a lack of power due to a large sandstorm on Mars in 2018. The mission was declared over on Feb. 13, 2019, having lasted for 15 years \u2014 far beyond design expectations \u2014 and finding ample evidence of water on the surface.\n\nPhoenix Mars Lander: U.S., launched Aug. 4, 2007. The Mars lander touched down on May 25, 2008 and dug through Martian soil to confirm the presence of water ice beneath the surface. Phoenix's solar panels suffered severe damage from the harsh Martian winter, and communication with the $475 million lander was lost in November 2008. After repeated attempts to reestablish contact, NASA declared Phoenix broken and dead in May 2010.\n\nPhobos-Grunt: (FAILED) Russia, launched Nov. 8, 2011 on a mission to return samples from the Mars moon Phobos. The $163 million robotic probe suffered a crippling malfunction shortly after launch, stranding it in Earth orbit. Mission managers said Phobos-Grunt spacecraft's thrusters failed to fire in a maneuver that would have sent the spacecraft on to Mars. The spacecraft plummeted back to Earth and was destroyed on Jan. 15, 2012.\n\nMars Science Laboratory/Curiosity: U.S., launched Nov. 26, 2011. The $2.5 billion Curiosity rover landed at Gale crater on the night of Aug. 5, 2012, and has spent the last several year investigating Mount Sharp/Aeolis Mons to learn about the history of water across Martian geologic periods. The Mars rover is investigating whether the planet was ever hospitable to life, and has found ample evidence of organic molecules and water in the past decade. Its primary mission has been extended several times.\n\nSchiaparelli (FAILED): European Space Agency, launched March 14, 2016 with a failed landing attempt on Oct. 19, 2016. Schiaparelli was a landing demonstrator meant to test future landing technologies for Martian missions. It arrived safely at the Red Planet with the Trace Gas Orbiter, but conflicting data caused the little probe to crash into the surface. Happily, however, TGO safely remained in orbit as planned and continues to collect data.\n\nInSight: U.S., launched May 5, 2018 and landed Nov. 26, 2018. InSight is equipped to probe the interior of Mars and has found ample evidence of marsquakes. One of its larger goals is to better understand the history and formation of rocky planets more generally, using Mars as a test bed for our theories. Engineers spent two Earth years attempting to put a heat-seeking mole under the surface, but the effort ultimately was called off because the regolith (soil) was harder than expected. InSight is now on an extended mission, having met its primary mission goals.\n\nFollow Space.com on Twitter @Spacedotcom and on Facebook.", "meta_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q7ZubLErqWQDQ2UjHg2R3H-1200-80.jpg"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9954978227615356}, "keywords": [""], "summary": "The Perseverance rover , carrying the Ingenuity helicopter for testing flight on Mars , is scheduled to touch down on Feb. 18. \n\n The new rover follows a long heritage of landers , rovers and other craft that have attempted to explore the Red Planet."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "516ae003-10ee-4bb2-aa45-2ed2181f1218", "source": "space.com", "data": {"title": "NASA's Perseverance rover is one week away from a daring landing on Mars.

(Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\nThe new 4K Perseverance landing video opens with a shot of Mars, soon followed by Perseverance streaking towards the surface after separating from a protective backshell.\n\nTucked in special casing, the rover will make its way through the upper part of the atmosphere, streaking across the sky. Close to landing, it is hoped that microphones on board will pick up the whistling of the wind \u2014 which is likely why NASA puts that noise in the video, too.\n\nThe protective case will pop a parachute. Closer to landing, the bottom will fall away, with the top remaining clamped to the rover for a final steer to the surface. A dramatic view from the video shows the wheels of Perseverance exposed to the thin Martian atmosphere; moments later, the case backshell fires jets to slow down the landing even further.\n\nIn photos: NASA's Mars Perseverance rover to the Red Planet\n\nManeuvering under the jets, the rover will make final adjustments to its landing site before beginning a controlled descent to the surface with a special \"sky crane.\" Just as the wheels settle to the Martian regolith (soil), the crane will rip away from Perseverance and the shell will crash safely away from the rover, allowing it to get rolling as soon as a routine systems check shows everything is alright.\n\nA last dramatic pan from the video shows Perseverance all on its own on the surface, although the rover will hopefully be in contact with hundreds of scientists and engineers on Earth to plan its first moves.\n\nLaunched in July 2020, the Perseverance rover is expected to land on Mars at 3:55 p.m. EST (2055 GMT).

Since then, shares have risen nearly fivefold, as investors bet on the company to eventually launch space tourists and science missions to space.\n\nBy going public, Astra will be able to generate the money needed to build smaller rockets in higher numbers and launch them from a variety of different locations in a faster time frame, Kemp told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box earlier this month .\n\nUnlike other rocket makers, Astra's focus is on creating inexpensive (launch costs could be as low as $3 million), automated rockets that can be controlled remotely and shipped anywhere depending on what a customer needs, akin to \"the FedEx of space,\" according to a Bloomberg profile . While nascent, the technology was convincing enough to become one of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2019s (DARPA) three finalists in a two-year contest known as the Launch Challenge.\n\nAstra's Rocket 3.2 lifts off from the Alaskan coast on Dec. 15, 2020 in this montage of mission photos. (Image credit: Astra/John Kraus)\n\nIn contrast, SpaceX has focused on launching its reusable, 23-story Falcon 9 rockets from four sites, most notably NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX's cost per launch is $62 million, according to its website, but in 2020, it unveiled a tool to allow small satellite customers to use its ride-share service for as little as $1 million for 440-lb. (200 kilograms) payloads.\n\nIn December, Astra successfully reached space with its Rocket 3.2 launch vehicle. Just a few operators were in Kodiak, Alaska, on the ground for setting up the launch. The upper stage reached 16,106 mph (25,920 kph), which was just shy of orbital velocity, or the 17,180 mph (27,649 kph) needed to swing into orbit around Earth. Even so, the company is confident it will be able to do so after making some software tweaks, and it is looking to launch standard satellites for customers later this year.\n\nHowever, Astra may face stiff competition from top players in the field \u2014 notably, SpaceX and United Launch Alliance , a joint-venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nKemp said the company has more than 50 launches lined up for customers in the coming months. However, he hinted that Astra will be much more than a small rocket-maker in the not-too-distant future, as the company seeks to build \"a platform of space services that will catalyze a wave of innovation that will benefit our planet in ways unimaginable today.\"\n\nSpace.com Collection: $26.99 at Magazines Direct Get ready to explore the wonders of our incredible universe!

Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThe prospects of a big government spending program could continue to boost the stock market and put upward pressure on interest rates in the week ahead. Earnings season is beginning to wind down, but some big names have yet to report. Walmart's earnings on Thursday should provide a good window into the consumer, as should the government's retail sales report for January, also expected Wednesday. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday afternoon releases minutes from its last meeting, and investors will dig into those for any insight into the central bank's view on inflation.\n\nTwo dominant themes amid stimulus prospects\n\nInflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law. \"The market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. It's going to be important. They can get it through reconciliation,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n\nKrosby said that Democrats could pass the stimulus under budget reconciliation, which means they could approve it with a simple majority instead of relying on negotiations with Republicans. Some in the markets had anticipated a package of $1 trillion or less if there was a negotiated deal, but that now looks unlikely. Strategists have changed their view on the proposed $1.9 trillion package. \"There is less pushback to President Biden's proposed stimulus from moderate Democrats than we expected, so a price tag of around $1.5 trillion seems likely, which is higher than we initially thought,\" noted Cornerstone Macro policy analysts. They say they expect a bill to come up for a vote during the week of Feb. 22, and that it could become law by the first week of March. Investors will stay focused on its progress through Congress. Market pros expect the bigger the spending package, the larger the pop will be in economic growth in the near term. That has helped send Treasury yields, which move opposite price, to higher levels. It has also increased concerns about inflation.\n\nInflation and rising yields\n\nIn the past week, the 10-year yield \u2014 a key benchmark \u2014 touched 1.2% for the first time since March. It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday. Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher. \"If you think about the big drivers, they're related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,\" said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. \"If there's more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.\" The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy. At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target. Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor. \"Because there's such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we'll see if that has eased,\" she said. \"Obviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,\" said Krosby. Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.\n\nHousing statistics\n\nHousing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week. The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales. On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.\n\nUpcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes\n\nStocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934. There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares, which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those advances. Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily shorted names. Robinhood's CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel. The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market's advance is intact. \"Overall, it's a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,\" Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad based and there's cyclical leadership. \"The low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,\" said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week. The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.\n\nWeek ahead calendar", "meta_img": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106823255-1610479020429-wall.jpg?v=1611354603"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.7034893035888672}, "keywords": ["Coronavirus: Business", "Interest Rates", "Market Insider", "Wall Street", "Markets", "Stock markets", "Earnings", "Owens Corning", "Applied Materials Inc", "Dropbox Inc", "Consolidated Edison Inc", "Southern Co", "Walmart Inc", "Analog Devices Inc", "Palantir Technologies Inc", "Cheesecake Factory Inc", "Pioneer Natural Resources Co", "Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc", "US Foods Holding Corp", "Avis Budget Group Inc", "Occidental Petroleum Corp", "CVS Health Corp", "Deere & Co", "Donald Trump", "Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc", "Vulcan Materials Co", "Marathon Oil Corp", "U.S. 10 Year Treasury", "GameStop Corp", "Donald Trump", "business news"], "summary": "The market is waiting to see how big the package is going to be. \n\n Two dominant themes amid stimulus prospects \n\n Inflation and rising interest rates have been two dominant themes for investors recently and have become increasingly so as the market has upgraded its view of how much fiscal coronavirus stimulus could be signed into law \"."}, "category": "Business"}, {"id": "d0d41a8d-458a-4a23-8654-50dfba552319", "source": "cnbc", "data": {"title": "After U.S. SPAC frenzy, blank-check firms eye deals in Europe's burgeoning tech sector", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/spac-frenzy-blank-check-firms-eye-deals-in-europes-tech-sector.html", "description": "An increasing number of blank-check firms are listing in New York with an aim to buy a European tech firm.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 10:32:59 GMT", "body": "The bronze Charging Bull in the financial district of New York City. Robert Nickelsberg | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 The SPAC craze is starting to gain some momentum in Europe. After a banner year for so-called special purpose acquisition companies in the U.S., a growing number of blank-check firms are raising funds with the intention of snapping up a European tech company. SPACs are shell companies that are created with the sole purpose of raising funds to acquire an existing private company, so that the target firm can bypass the traditional initial public offering (IPO) process. These blank-check companies raised a total of $78.2 billion across 244 IPOs in the U.S. last year, according to data from Refinitiv. The U.S. SPAC mania continued into 2021, with another 134 firms raising nearly $39 billion since the start of the year. The attraction of SPACs is that they offer a way for companies to fast-track a stock market listing. An IPO can be a much longer process, and some firms are eschewing the traditional route to avoid potential swings in market sentiment. IPOs have also attracted criticism from venture capitalists like Ben Gurley, who worry they are being underpriced. SPACs provide an alternative to IPOs, as well as direct listings where firms sell existing shares to public market investors. They often attract high-growth tech firms. Last year, U.K. electric vehicle maker Arrival announced a deal to go public via a merger with a U.S. blank-check firm.\n\nMostly a U.S. phenomenon\n\nEurope has largely missed out on the SPAC boom. Just three SPACs listed in Europe last year, netting $495 million. And not a single SPAC has debuted in the continent so far this year.\n\nSPACs aren't a new phenomenon, but they flourished in the U.S. in 2020. Investors' funds are held in a trust account after a SPAC completes its IPO, and shareholders can vote against the deal if they don't agree with it and get their money back. Industry insiders say that SPACs tend to be structured differently in the U.S. compared to Europe. And Europe is home to far fewer publicly-listed tech companies than America, which makes it harder for investors and analysts to make comparisons and benchmark firms in the sector. London's stock exchange is looking to lure more SPACs and has contacted law firms and banks to see if they can facilitate the listing of such vehicles, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC. The person preferred to remain anonymous as the talks haven't been made public. Meanwhile, the U.K. has launched a review into its listings rules in a bid to attract more tech firms to the market. Europe as a whole had a markedly quiet year in terms of tech IPOs last year, whereas the U.S. saw a flurry of major debuts from the likes of DoorDash and Airbnb. \"Unfortunately in Europe, interesting and attractive companies don't have the same access to capital as they do in the U.S., either in the private domain, nor on the public markets,\" Makram Azar, CEO of Golden Falcon Acquisition Corp, a SPAC focused on European tech, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" Friday. \"The venture capital pool of money for example is much smaller in Europe than it is in the U.S. and the IPO market is very weak.\"\n\nDeals in the works\n\nAn increasing number of blank-check firms are listing in New York with an aim to buy a European tech firm. Azar, the former chairman of banking for Europe at Barclays, raised $345 million for his SPAC in an IPO in December. Golden Falcon is looking to take a European \"champion\" in tech, media and telecoms (TMT) or fintech public.", "meta_img": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106839744-1613124725309-gettyimages-1277228344-_dsc0449.jpeg?v=1613124829"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.5728062987327576}, "keywords": ["Mergers and acquisitions", "Venture capital", "Markets", "Technology", "Adyen NV", "Golden Falcon Acquisition Corp", "North Atlantic Acquisition Corp", "business news"], "summary": "These blank - check companies raised a total of $ 78.2 billion across 244 IPOs in the U.S. last year , according to data from Refinitiv.

When asked later by CNBC to clarify his remarks, Pinto, who leads the world's biggest investment bank by revenue, said the firm's decision would be informed by whether a critical mass of clients wanted the firm to trade bitcoin.\n\n\"If over time an asset class develops that is going to be used by different asset managers and investors, we will have to be involved,\" Pinto said in an interview. \"The demand isn't there yet, but I'm sure it will be at some point.\"\n\nJPMorgan traders aren't the only ranks of the cryptocurious at big banks. Last week, Goldman Sachs hosted a private forum with Mike Novogratz, the CEO-founder of crypto firm Galaxy Digital, for employees and clients. Novogratz expounded on his thesis for bitcoin, ethereum and other digital assets as well as their macroeconomic backdrop during the 90-minute virtual event.\n\nWall Street's newfound openness to cryptocurrency shows that the industry is being forced to contend with bitcoin as its latest dizzying ascent and increased adoption among institutional investors, corporations and fintech competitors spark fears of being left behind.\n\nBanks, which generally face the highest regulatory scrutiny among financial firms because of the breadth of their operations and crucial role in the economy, have been largely reluctant to play in the crypto space, preferring to focus on related technology including blockchain.

Getty\n\nLONDON \u2014 The European Innovation Council has encountered some early setbacks but is now headed in the right direction, according to a vice chair of the advisory board Hermann Hauser, who became a venture capitalist after helping to set up chip designer Arm. The EIC has been given 10 billion euros ($12 billion) to invest in European start-ups between 2021 and 2027 as part of the EU's Horizon initiative. It will invest up to 15 million euros in a particular start-up in exchange for a maximum stake of 10-25%. \"I never thought Brussels would go for this but we are allowed to do equity investments, and this is unbelievable,\" Hauser told CNBC from his farm in New Zealand, where he has been stuck since last March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. \"This is beginning,\" said Hauser, who wants to see the money invested in companies focusing on AI, machine learning, quantum computing, and blockchain technologies. \"We've got start-up problems and I wouldn't say that it's a perfectly smooth machine, but it's beginning to work quite well.\" Hauser said the EIC's start-up problems existed because it had delays in setting up all the necessary procedures. The fund's 10 billion euro budget was confirmed in December following a four-year pilot that saw 2 billion euros invested. The EIC was set up by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, to try to help start-ups across Europe to scale up and compete with rivals in the U.S. and Asia, which have spawned several tech giants with market caps that run well into hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nIn the U.S. there's Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and so on. In China there's Huawei, Alibaba, Baidu, and others. In Europe, there's a handful of tech companies valued in the tens of billions \u2014 think Adyen, Spotify and Arm \u2014 and next to none valued at over $100 billion, except SAP and ASML. European politicians have also expressed a desire to start sourcing more essential digital services from European companies as opposed to foreign ones.\n\nTurning start-ups into scale-ups\n\n\"Europe doesn't have a start-up problem,\" said Hauser, who is also a venture partner in Amadeus Capital in Cambridge. \"We produce more start-ups than the U.S. Europe has a scale-up problem and a deep tech finance problem. Both of which are addressed by the EIC.\" So far, the EIC has made 48 investments, spending 180 million euros in the process, according to Hauser. One recipient, French start-up CorWave, is developing pumps that can help people with heart failure.\n\nHowever, some tech investors and entrepreneurs raised concerns that Brussels doesn't know how to spot, support and invest in promising start-ups. Hauser said he had similar concerns: \"Of course, the thing that I was immediately worried about was \u2026 don't let the Brussels guys decide who to invest in or not,\" he said. To get around this issue, Hauser introduced a rule that means the EIC fund can only invest in a start-up's funding round when the majority of the money is coming from private investors. \"It needs the VC community because it's not allowed to make any investment unless the majority of the money comes from the market,\" he said. Hauser said the EIC also has the advantage of being so close to the well-established European Research Council, which he thinks has backed some of the best tech projects in Europe. \"So in terms of the technical due diligence, I think we actually have something to bring to the party for the VCs,\" he said.\n\nBiggest deep tech fund in Europe", "meta_img": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106701239-1600087219241-GettyImages-953984286.jpg?v=1613127178"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9986395239830017}, "keywords": ["Business", "Start-up", "Investment strategy", "Venture capital", "Technology", "business news"], "summary": "The EIC has been given 10 billion euros ( $ 12 billion ) to invest in European start - ups between 2021 and 2027 as part of the EU 's Horizon initiative.

This refers to vehicles such as delivery drones and air taxis.\n\nAccording to Urban Air Port, the development will be launched in the English city of Coventry this year. The firm wants to roll out 200 similar sites around the world in the next five years.\n\nOther organizations involved in the initiative planned for Coventry include the city's council and Hyundai Motor Group. Alongside its involvement in the Coventry project, Hyundai is also developing its own eVTOL and is looking to commercialize the tech by 2028.\n\nElsewhere, smaller companies such as Lilium are working on similar offerings. The German-based firm said last month that it had signed an agreement with infrastructure giant Ferrovial to develop at least ten \"vertiports\" in the U.S.\n\nIn a statement at the time, Lilium stressed the importance of these hubs, noting they provided \"infrastructure for landing, recharging, and taking off with passengers.\"\n\nBig changes coming, but challenges ahead\n\nTo some, the idea of electric, airborne delivery drones and air taxis becoming crucial cogs in future transportation systems may seem outlandish.

The listing took place in Hong Kong rather than in the U.S., and DCM co-founder David Chao expects China's most prominent tech start-ups to follow suit.\n\nThe primary reason, Chao says, is four years of the Trump Administration's \"political bashing\" of Chinese companies.\n\n\"You've had this heightened adversarial relationship between the U.S. and China,\" said Chao, whose 25-year-old firm backs start-ups in the U.S., China and Japan. Between Trump's pounding of Huawei and promise to delist some Chinese firms, \"that really made Chinese companies rethink about going public in the U.S.,\" Chao said.\n\nIn the past, U.S. exchanges have been highly competitive in luring top Chinese companies. The country's two biggest e-retailers, Alibaba and JD.com, went public on the Nasdaq in 2014. They were preceded years earlier by internet company Baidu, gaming platform NetEase and travel site Ctrip (now Trip.com).\n\nBut the trend has shifted away from the U.S., as China's biggest tech successes choose to stay closer to home. Hong Kong is the world's fourth-largest exchange in terms of total market cap of listed companies, trailing the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange.\n\nHong Kong was gaining strength even before the Trump-China trade war, Chao said. The past four years just sped it up.\n\nIn January, the NYSE responded to an executive order from then President Trump, signed in November, barring Americans from investing in 31 companies identified by the Department of Defense as \"Communist Chinese military\" companies. That list included NYSE companies China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicm, which are all co-listed in Hong Kong.\n\nRegardless of the approach the Biden administration takes, Chao expects Hong Kong to remain strong because \"companies are seeing they can go public in Hong Kong and be just as big.\"\n\nKuaishou, which works similarly to short video app TikTok, was the latest large tech company to IPO in Hong Kong, following shopping site Meituan and smartphone maker Xiaomi in 2018.

(NYSE: DM), today, Thursday, December 10, 2020, in celebration of its listing. To honor the occasion, Ric Fulop, Co-Founder and CEO, rings The Opening Bell\u00ae. NYSE\n\nRoger Lee of Battery Ventures says that \"SPAC\" used to be a \"bad four-letter word\" in Silicon Valley. Now, the board of every high-profile start-up is discussing special purpose acquisition companies as a legitimate way to go public, according to Jeff Crowe of Norwest Venture Partners. In the eyes of Lux Capital co-founder Peter Hebert, SPACs are \"stealing from the 2021 IPO calendar.\" \"We have encouraged our highest-quality companies to seriously consider this,\" said Hebert, whose firm raised its own health-tech SPAC in October and is looking for a target. \"The vast majority of companies looking at doing traditional public offerings are dual-tracking SPACs.\" Within Lux's portfolio, 3D-printing company Desktop Metal went public through a SPAC in December. Others like real estate software companies Latch and Matterport have announced deals this year with so-called blank-check companies. The sudden burst of SPACs reminds some long-timers of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. Pre-revenue businesses with far-out goals are going public at astronomical valuations, and famous athletes and other celebrities are getting in the mix. Mention the acronym to any well-known start-up CEO and you'll likely hear about the non-stop calls they receive from sponsors with hundreds of millions of dollars to spend.\n\nTo Wall Street skeptics, it looks like the finance industry's latest scheme to make money from speculators in a low interest rate environment with the market at a peak and investors hungry for all things tech. SPACs have raised more than $44 billion so far this year for 144 deals, according to SPACInsider. That's equal to more than half the money raised in all of 2020, which itself was a record year. While there's undeniable mania in the SPAC boom, there's another story playing out in parallel. Venture-backed tech companies with high-growth prospects are shunning the IPO process, which has its own flaws. Instead they're getting comfortable with the idea of hitting the market in a way that would have been unfathomable just a year ago. In a SPAC, a group of investors raise money for a shell company with no underlying business. The SPAC goes public, generally at $10 a share, and then starts hunting for a company to acquire. When it finds a target and a deal is agreed upon, the SPAC and the company pull in outside investors for what's called a PIPE, or private investment in public equity. The PIPE money goes onto the target company's balance sheet in exchange for a big equity stake. The SPAC investors get stock in the acquired company, which becomes the publicly-traded entity through what's known as the de-SPAC. One major advantage: SPACs allow companies to provide forward-looking projections, which companies typically don't do in IPO prospectuses because of liability risk. \"An IPO is what I would call backward-looking,\" said Betsy Cohen, who led a SPAC that recently took car insurer Metromile public. \"Because a SPAC is technically a merger, you're required to tell investors what the merged companies will look like after the merger and project forward.\" It's also a much faster process than the IPO, which involves spending many months with bankers and lawyers to draft a prospectus, educate the market, carry out a roadshow and build a book of institutional investors.\n\nFin-tech companies have been big SPAC targets\n\nMany of the better-known SPAC targets so far have been at the intersection of tech and financial services. For these companies, cash burn rates are high and real GAAP profits often won't come for years, even under the best circumstances.\n\nMetromile, whose technology allows drivers to pay by the mile rather than a monthly fee, started trading on Wednesday after merging with INSU Acquisition Corp. II, a SPAC led by Cohen and her son, Daniel. Chamath Palihapitiya, the venture capitalist turned mega SPAC sponsor, and billionaire Marc Cuban invested in a $160 million PIPE. As of Friday's close, the stock was trading at $17.23, giving Metromile a valuation of over $2 billion based on the fully diluted share count. \"Metromile enters the insurance market at a time when telematics are installed in virtually every car going forward, so there's the opportunity to look at insurance on an individualized customized basis, which is huge,\" Cohen said in an interview. \"We felt it was an important company to bring to the public markets and allow them to have access to capital the way insurance companies do.\" Cohen, who founded The Bancorp, said she will have closed seven SPACs by later this year, including payments company Payoneer and boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg. Metromile CEO Dan Preston told CNBC this week that around the middle of 2020, as his board was evaluating financing options, he expected to raise a large round of private capital and then go public in four to six quarters. The company had been around for a decade and raised hundreds of millions of dollars in funding.\n\nMetromile CEO Dan Preston Winni Wintermeyer\n\nOther insurance-tech businesses like Lemonade and Root held traditional IPOs last year. But Preston says the more he learned about SPACs, the more he realized it was the better approach for his company, which faced the high costs of operating in the heavily regulated insurance industry \u2014 and a pandemic that slashed the amount of miles driven. \"The sweet spot are companies that are pretty close to being public but need a little more historical data to get ready,\" said Preston. Metromile said in its merger filing that it expects insurance revenue to increase 39% to $142.1 million in 2021, and then jump 81% in 2022 and more than 100% in 2023. Adjusted gross profit will increase from $11.1 million last year to $144 million in 2023, the filing says. Online lender SoFi said in January that it was going public through a SPAC run by Palihapitiya in a deal valuing the company at $8.65 billion. In the merger agreement, SoFi projects annual revenue of $980 million this year, increasing annually to $3.7 billion in 2025, while contribution profit will more than quintuple over that stretch to $1.5 billion.\n\nIn other finance SPACs, Palihapitiya led the reverse-merger of digital real estate company Opendoor, which went public last year and is now worth over $20 billion. He did the same with health insurer Clover Health (which said this month that it's under investigation by the SEC) and is leading the PIPE for solar financing provider Sunlight Financial.\n\nTop-tier investors joining the fray\n\nHe's also doing software deals. In January, Palihapitiya was a PIPE investor in Latch, a developer of smart lock systems sold to real estate companies. Latch generates recurring software sales and said 2020 booked revenue jumped 49% from the prior year to $167 million. Blackrock, Fidelity and Wellington are also part of the PIPE, meaning they'll be equity holders when Latch goes public. Those names, viewed as top-tier public market investors, are becoming familiar to SPACs, with at least one of them showing up in the PIPE for SoFi, Matterport, Opendoor and consumer genetics company 23andMe. For companies that can attract investors of that caliber, and have sponsors they trust to stick with them through the ups and downs of the journey, a SPAC can be the most efficient way to raise money. Large private rounds typically require hefty dilution, while IPOs often come with a discount of 50% to 100% for new investors. In a SPAC, the target ends up handing up to 20% of shares to the sponsors and additional stock to PIPE investors. The rest primarily remains with insiders. When public, the company has the ability to raise follow-on capital at market rates. For example, Opendoor just announced it's raising $770 million at $27 a share, marking an increase in valuation of about 200% from the time of the PIPE investment. Norwest's Crowe, whose firm was a venture investor in Opendoor and online therapy provider Talkspace, another SPAC target, said that pricing is favorable for the best companies because there are so many SPACs going after them. \"Pricing is nuts,\" Crowe said. \"There's enormous pent-up demand for all these companies. A lot of companies that would've gone public in a relatively even fashion over 2021 and '22, if markets hold, now are all going out in a mad rush.\" Venture investors are jumping in as well. In addition to Lux, firms including FirstMark Capital, Ribbit Capital, Khosla Ventures and SoftBank have raised their own SPACs. Separate from their firms, venture capitalists Steve Case, Reid Hoffman and Bradley Tusk have followed Palihapitiya into the SPAC sponsor arena. Growth stage venture firm G Squared announced this week the close of a $345 million SPAC. Founder Larry Aschebrook, in an interview, called it \"just another tool in our toolbox\" to help companies access capital. He said it can be a good option for a CEO who's ready to run a public company and a business that's raised a lot of money in the past and can benefit from ready access to the capital markets.\n\nG Squared Ascend I Inc.

Disney saw a not-unexpected slump in theme park attendance and box office results due to Covid, but the success of its Disney+ streaming service continues. Disney+ now has 94.9 million subscribers after adding more than 21 million during the quarter. Disney shares rose 1.4% in premarket trading as of 7:30 a.m. ET.\n\nNewell Brands (NWL) \u2013 The company behind consumer brands like Rubbermaid, Sharpie and Sunbeam reported quarterly profit of 56 cents per share, beating estimates by 8 cents a share. Revenue came in above estimates as well. Newell forecast full-year earnings at $1.55 to $1.65 per share, compared with a consensus estimate of $1.68 a share, amid softness in its writing business that's cutting into strong performances in areas such as appliances and cookware. The stock fell 2.5% in pre-market action.\n\nCoherent (COHR) \u2013 Electronic components maker II-VI (IIVI) is planning a $6.5 billion bid for the laser maker, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Wall Street Journal. The bid is worth $260 per share in cash and stock, topping the $226 per share agreement that Coherent already has with Lumentum Holdings (LITE) as well as a $240 per share bid from MKS Instruments (MKSI). Coherent surged 16.4% in premarket trading, while II-VI fell 4.3%.\n\nMoody's (MCO) \u2013 Higher expenses caused the credit rating agency to miss estimates by 6 cents a share, with quarterly earnings of $1.91 per share. Revenue exceeded Wall Street forecasts, however its projected full-year 2021 earnings range is largely above analyst forecasts. Moody's also raised its quarterly dividend to 62 cents per share from 56 cents a share.\n\nExpedia (EXPE) \u2013 Expedia slid 1.6% premarket after reporting that it lost $2.64 per share for its latest quarter, wider than the loss of $1.97 per share that analysts were anticipating. The online travel services company's revenue fell short of forecasts, amid a 67% drop in bookings due to the resurgence of Covid-19 cases and lockdowns.\n\nAffirm Holdings (AFRM) \u2013 Affirm tumbled 7.6% premarket after it reported a loss of 45 cents per share in its first results since going public on Jan. 13. That was smaller than the 81 cents a share loss anticipated by Wall Street, and the provider of buy-now, pay-later loans also saw revenue beat forecasts. Affirm forecast weaker-than-expected sales volume for the current quarter, however, as the pandemic-induced boom in online shopping slows.\n\nSurveyMonkey (SVMK) \u2013 SurveyMonkey tumbled 10.8% in the premarket, after the online survey company provided weaker-than-expected guidance for the current quarter. SurveyMonkey reported a profit of 3 cents per share for its most recent quarter, compared to expectations of a breakeven quarter.\n\nMarathon Oil (MRO) \u2013 Marathon has laid off about 100 U.S. workers, or about 5% of its workforce, according to a company official who spoke to Reuters.

Adam Hagy | Major League Baseball | Getty Images\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers recently signed 2020 National League Cy Young winner Trevor Bauer to one of the most unique contracts in Major League Baseball history. Bauer agreed to a three-year, $102 million deal with the team on Thursday, making him one of the highest-paid players per year, theoretically, as the pact unfolds. It has opt-outs that trigger top salary, a deferment and a short-term model structure. But most of all, it has flexibility, something a player of Bauer's talent usually avoids. \"This is what this player wanted,\" Jon Fetterolf, a partner at litigation firm Zuckerman Spaeder, told CNBC on Thursday. Fetterolf is one of the two MLB co-agents who negotiated Bauer's deal. The other is Rachel Luba of Luba Sports. \"We ended up doing a three-year deal where he is going to make a lot more in the first few years than we've historically seen,\" he added, noting Bauer could make $85 million in the first two years of the deal. Again, it's unique, and here's how it's structured.\n\nInside the deal\n\nBauer is scheduled to make $38 million in his first year. If he opts out of the deal, that total becomes $40 million, as the Dodgers would pay him an extra $2 million on his way out. The Dodgers can benefit. If Bauer departs, they can defer $20 million of the salary for future payment \u2013 similar to the Mets' agreement with Bobby Bonilla. There's also a $10 million signing bonus factored in to paid out over the 2021 season. That bonus helps, since the money is only taxed in the player's state residence, whereas MLB game checks are taxed based on the city where clubs play during the year. Year two of the deal totals $47 million. It's $32 million for the year but, should he opt-out, the Dodgers will pay him another $15 million. These salaries make Bauer the highest-paid player (per-year) in MLB for 2021 and 2022. And if Bauer is still a Dodger after two years, he misses the $15 million buyout but recoups it all with a $32 million payment for the deal's final year. The total: $102 million over three years. \"The structure gives him the chance to evaluate the situation year-by-year,\" Fetterolf said. \"It's a different kind of contract, and it also reflects that he's a different kind of person.\"\n\nShort-term thinking\n\nBauer, 30, has made his share of public relations mistakes. But a player of his caliber usually goes the long-term route \u2013 taking money and security over several years. For example, New York Yankees pitcher Gerrit Cole signed a nine-year deal valued at roughly $324 million in 2019. He was 28 at the time but was locked into his contract until age 37. Bauer and Cole were teammates at UCLA, and both were selected at the top of the 2011 MLB Draft. Once drafted and with an MLB club, it takes players six years to become a free agent, and along the way, they make the minimum salary of the collective bargaining agreement. Once service time is reached, players have the right to negotiate with the team on salary, and if they disagree, there is an arbitration panel to determine the compensation. If players don't agree to long-term deals during that window, especially starting pitchers, they'll agree once they hit free agency. Bauer emulated new teammate, David Price, who took a similar path to his mega deal. Price put in his years of service with the Tampa Bay Rays, endured salary arbitration along the way, and bet on himself with a one-year deal with the Detroit Tigers for the 2015 season. He flipped that into a seven-year, $217 million contract with the Boston Red Sox at age 30. Both Price and Bauer were four-year salary arbitration players, traded by their clubs, and took one-year deals before landing mega contracts. Now 35, Price was traded to the Dodgers last February and is scheduled to make $32 million for the 2021 season. He'll be 37 once the deal is up after the 2022 season. Fetterolf and Luba have been hired to represent numerous players in salary arbitration. Fetterolf explained why Bauer selected the short-term model instead of the long-play. \"Theoretically, if you're not going to go most years, most dollars, he wants to give himself the ability to control his life,\" Fetterolf said, using short-term basketball contracts as an example. \"He could have done the max,\" Fetterolf said. \"He hasn't done that. Why? Because he wants to make sure that he's in a situation that he likes. I think that's different. We see that in basketball. I think one of the reasons we see it in basketball is these guys can make so much money off the court, far more than baseball players usually make,\" he continued. \"But a lot of these guys want to make sure they are in a situation where they will have a chance to win.\"\n\nTrevor Bauer #27 of the Cincinnati Reds pitches in the third inning against the Milwaukee Brewers at Miller Park on August 07, 2020 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

As thousands of pharmacies get shipments of doses and start vaccinations at their stores this week, the country is taking a significant step toward reaching more Americans. Public health officials and advocates, however, say that won't go far enough in communities where people have been the sickest. More Black and Hispanic Americans have been hospitalized and died from Covid-19. They often face bigger barriers to get vaccine, too: A lack of transportation. A juggle of multiple jobs. Hesitance because of past mistreatment by the medical community. CVS Health and Walgreens will play a bigger role in the effort as a federal program ships doses to more of their stores and those of other retail pharmacies. The expansion represents a business opportunity for the nation's two largest pharmacy chains as they get paid for each vaccine and draw more foot traffic to stores. The vaccine rollout will also test the companies' commitment to expanding health-care access in Black and Hispanic communities. Banks, an infectious disease doctor in Ohio, is part of an interest group of the Infectious Diseases Society of America that's made up of Black physicians, scientists and public health officials focused on addressing health-care disparities. She said health-care providers will have to get creative and show commitment. She said they should set up clinics in familiar places, such as churches, and enlist \"trusted messengers\" like pastors and community leaders. \"You've got to look at from a cultural standpoint 'Where are we?' and come to us,\" she said.\n\nMore than fairness\n\nThe vaccine's rollout in the U.S. has been slow and complex. Demand for doses has far outweighed the number of shots available to jab into arms. Online appointment systems have been tricky to navigate and bogged down by heavy traffic. Only two vaccines have emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration so far, and they must stored at cold and ultra-cold temperatures. And only some Americans qualify for the shot, with each state having slightly different criteria to weigh factors like a person's age, medical conditions or job. About 48.4 million vaccines have been administered in the U.S. as of Friday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 12.1 million people have received both doses of the vaccine \u2014 just a small fraction of the 331 million people who live in the U.S. The country's goal is to vaccinate between 70% and 85% of the U.S. population \u2014 or roughly 232 million to 281 million people \u2014 to achieve herd immunity, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president's chief medical advisor.\n\nPeople without appointments stand in line to possibly receive a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine after all appointments have been administered at the Sun City Anthem Community Center vaccination site in Henderson, Nevada, on Thursday, Feb. 11, 2021. Roger Kisby | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nThe messy rollout has led to some getting shots and not others. Most of the nearly 13 million people given at least one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine within the first month of the drugs' distribution were women, age 50 or older and likely non-Hispanic and White, according to a CDC study.\n\nFor vaccine distribution, equity is not only a matter of fairness. It's also a crucial way to slow the spread in communities where Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are higher. Black and Hispanic Americans are 3.7 times and 4.1 times more likely be hospitalized from Covid than White Americans, according to data reported by the CDC in late November. Both of the minority groups are 2.8 times more likely than White Americans to die from the disease. In a hard-hit neighborhood, each shot's impact can be even greater \u2014 reaching people who are more at risk as they work in grocery stores or at other frontline jobs or live in a dense apartment or multigenerational households.\n\nVaccine hesitance is higher among Black and Brown people, too, stemming from the medical community's history of mistreating minority groups and opening fewer health-care practices in their neighborhoods. A poll of New York residents, conducted by the Association for a Better New York, found that 78% of White residents would take the vaccine as soon as they could compared with 39% of Black residents, 54% of Hispanics and 54% of Asians.\n\n'Put their money where their mouth is'\n\nFor providers like CVS and Walgreens, having more doses of the vaccine is a business opportunity. They will get paid for each vaccine and the government will pick up the cost if a person does not have health insurance. Jefferies estimated that each shot will have a $13 to $15 gross margin and could yield about $1 billion in incremental gross profits for CVS over the next year. Both drugstore chains have pinned their strategy on adding more health-care services from primary care clinics to diabetes screenings. They have also stepped up commitments to address racial inequities in response to George Floyd's killing and nationwide protests. CVS plans to invest nearly $600 million over five years to support public policy initiatives and internal efforts, such as mentoring Black employees and offering free health screenings for blood pressure and cholesterol at stores.\n\nWalgreens started a pilot project in the Chicago area that aims to reduce hospitalization rates by making it easier for patients to take their medications, get free deliveries of prescriptions and have more regular contact with health-care professionals about their medical conditions. It recently hired former Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer as its next CEO. When she steps into the role in mid-March, she will be only Black woman leading a Fortune 500 company. Karyne Jones, CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based National Caucus and Center on Black Aging, said expanding vaccines to hard-hit communities is a way for CVS and Walgreens to \"put their money where their mouth is.\" Her organization is a founding member of the Covid-19 Vaccine Education and Equity Project, a coalition of nonprofits and trade groups that's backed by vaccine-maker Pfizer. Jones said she would like to see CVS and Walgreens open 24-hour vaccination sites and set up tents in neighborhoods where people don't have transportation. \"If you really want to show good corporate responsibility, this is the time to say we have got to put resources toward alleviating this pandemic,\" she said.\n\nWe have pharmacy deserts. We have grocery store deserts. We don't have church deserts. Dr. Virginia Banks Infectious disease specialist\n\nBanks, the infectious disease doctor, said it will take outside-of-the-box strategies, such as rerouting bus routes to go by vaccine clinics. She pointed to an effort where pharmacists paired up with barber shops to detect high blood pressure when Black men went for a haircut \u2014 a clinical study that helped detect the condition and intervene earlier. She said she's hopeful that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine \u2014 which requires just one dose and can be transported more easily \u2014 could be a game changer for distribution and make it easier to give shots where people are. The company requested emergency use authorization from the FDA last week. \"We have pharmacy deserts,\" she said. \"We have grocery store deserts. We don't have church deserts.\"\n\nDoses in more neighborhoods\n\nWalgreens and CVS have given Covid vaccines at thousands of nursing homes and assisted living facilities. They have administered shots at some stores after getting vaccine doses from states. With the federal program, they will offer shots in more neighborhoods. Walgreens has Covid vaccines at stores in 15 states and two additional jurisdictions, New York City and Chicago. It will provide shots in 1,800 stores as part of the federal program \u2014 or roughly 20% of its U.S. stores, a company spokeswoman said. CVS has them in 18 states and Puerto Rico. As of Friday, about 420 of its approximately 9,900 stores will give the shots with doses from either a state or the federal program, a company spokesman said. Both pharmacy chains said they have chosen stores in neighborhoods with greater need. About half of each companies' stores with Covid vaccines are located in medically underserved areas or places that rank high on the CDC's social vulnerability index, which is based on factors like the prevalence of poverty, lack of vehicle access and crowded housing.", "meta_img": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106814483-1608572847744-gettyimages-1230249156-AFP_8XK6F8.jpeg?v=1608572897"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9882774949073792}, "keywords": ["Discrimination", "Race and ethnicity", "Immunizations", "Coronavirus: Prevention", "COVID-19", "Coronavirus", "Discount store and superstore operators", "Pharmacy operators", "Health care industry", "Johnson & Johnson", "BioNTech SE", "Pfizer Inc", "Walmart Inc", "Uber Technologies Inc", "Moderna Inc", "Starbucks Corp", "Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc", "CVS Health Corp", "Retail industry", "Business", "Breaking News: Business", "business news"], "summary": "Dr. Virginia Banks \n\n Dr. Virginia Banks says if the U.S. really wants to bring the pandemic to an end , it 's going to take mobile vans of vaccines in neighborhoods where people do n't have transportation \u2014 and even giving shots at hair salons and barber shops.

This refers to vehicles such as delivery drones and air taxis.\n\nAccording to Urban Air Port, the development will be launched in the English city of Coventry this year. The firm wants to roll out 200 similar sites around the world in the next five years.\n\nOther organizations involved in the initiative planned for Coventry include the city's council and Hyundai Motor Group. Alongside its involvement in the Coventry project, Hyundai is also developing its own eVTOL and is looking to commercialize the tech by 2028.\n\nElsewhere, smaller companies such as Lilium are working on similar offerings.

And that has occurred over the last year in this constrained supply and very strong demand environment on critical products such as the N95,\" Mike Vale, who leads 3M's safety and industrial business group, told CNBC.\n\nN95s have been the gold standard during the coronavirus pandemic for their ability to filter out at least 95% of airborne particles. The masks, which are seen as critical in protecting front-line workers from Covid-19, have been in short supply. 3M is the largest N95 manufacturer.\n\nFederal authorities announced Wednesday that scammers have distributed millions of fake N95s to health-care workers in at least five states. So far, 11,000 cases of the counterfeit masks have been reported by 3M, leading to 29 civil lawsuits. In total, the company said it's seized 10 million fake N95s. In mid-January, 3M helped its home state of Minnesota avoid buying nearly 500,000 counterfeit N95s from a Florida company. 3M sued and ended up winning an injunction.\n\nNews of the federal investigation into the counterfeit N95s comes as several hospitals across Washington state found out that their supply of the masks contained fakes.\n\n\"It's a stunning feeling ... just to think that there are people ... out manufacturing counterfeit personal protective equipment that we need right now so badly during this pandemic,\" Cassie Sauer, president of the Washington State Hospital Association, told NBC News earlier this week.\n\n3M helped officials in Washington confirm that the fake masks were purchased from an unauthorized distributor, which had no relationship with the company. 3M cautions that hospitals and medical clinics need to check that they're procuring respirators from a verified, authorized distributor. One way to do that is by checking the company's website or calling its anti-fraud hotline.\n\nDespite concerted efforts to shut down fraudsters and hold them accountable, phony masks continue to pop up across the United States and world. \"Fake N95s pose a serious health risk and I think 3M has been appropriately aggressive in getting them off the street. It's a game of whack-a-mole though, get rid of one and another pops up,\" said Scott Davis, CEO of Melius Research, who has been following 3M's evolution for several years.\n\nIn terms of production, 3M is now making more than 95 million respirators a month at its U.S. plants in South Dakota and Nebraska. By scaling production and hiring hundreds of additional workers, including 300 at its plant in South Dakota, the company has been able to quadruple production over the past year.\n\nYet a number of doctors who spoke with CNBC said they are still rationing masks.\n\n\"Obtaining enough N95s to safely cover health-care workers has an unsolved challenge, especially for the smaller hospitals and health-care facilities. Having to negotiate around counterfeit products makes it even more fraught and impossible to ensure adequate protection for our front line,\" said Dr. Natasha Anushri Anandaraja, who started Covid Courage, a nonprofit organization in New York helping health-care workers get access to PPE, including N95s and reusable masks.\n\nDue to limited supply, Anandaraja said that more medical workers are opting for reusable options. \"Providing each health-care worker with their own reusable mask will eliminate the constant struggle to find legitimate disposable masks and will eliminate the need for health-care workers to reuse masks that were meant for one-time use, and will save health systems hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.\"", "meta_img": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106667284-1597717256896-Shortlist_1_1.JPG?v=1597717600"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.97748863697052}, "keywords": ["COVID-19", "Counterfeiting and forgery", "Health care industry", "3M Co", "business news"], "summary": "So far , 11,000 cases of the counterfeit masks have been reported by 3 M , leading to 29 civil lawsuits. \n\n N95s have been the gold standard during the coronavirus pandemic for their ability to filter out at least 95 % of airborne particles."}, "category": "Sci/Tech"}, {"id": "180e341e-aa9e-4415-952e-ba6603f22888", "source": "cnbc", "data": {"title": "First look inside Lucid Motors' new factory in Casa Grande, Arizona", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/first-look-inside-lucid-motors-new-factory-in-casa-grande-arizona.html", "description": "CNBC got a first look inside Lucid Motors' new EV factory in Arizona.", "published": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 16:42:30 GMT", "body": "CNBC recently got a tour of Lucid Motors' new factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, where it will build its luxury electric sedan, the Air.

The listing took place in Hong Kong rather than in the U.S., and DCM co-founder David Chao expects China's most prominent tech start-ups to follow suit.\n\nThe primary reason, Chao says, is four years of the Trump Administration's \"political bashing\" of Chinese companies.\n\n\"You've had this heightened adversarial relationship between the U.S. and China,\" said Chao, whose 25-year-old firm backs start-ups in the U.S., China and Japan. Between Trump's pounding of Huawei and promise to delist some Chinese firms, \"that really made Chinese companies rethink about going public in the U.S.,\" Chao said.\n\nIn the past, U.S. exchanges have been highly competitive in luring top Chinese companies. The country's two biggest e-retailers, Alibaba and JD.com, went public on the Nasdaq in 2014. They were preceded years earlier by internet company Baidu, gaming platform NetEase and travel site Ctrip (now Trip.com).\n\nBut the trend has shifted away from the U.S., as China's biggest tech successes choose to stay closer to home. Hong Kong is the world's fourth-largest exchange in terms of total market cap of listed companies, trailing the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange.\n\nHong Kong was gaining strength even before the Trump-China trade war, Chao said. The past four years just sped it up.\n\nIn January, the NYSE responded to an executive order from then President Trump, signed in November, barring Americans from investing in 31 companies identified by the Department of Defense as \"Communist Chinese military\" companies. That list included NYSE companies China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicm, which are all co-listed in Hong Kong.\n\nRegardless of the approach the Biden administration takes, Chao expects Hong Kong to remain strong because \"companies are seeing they can go public in Hong Kong and be just as big.\"\n\nKuaishou, which works similarly to short video app TikTok, was the latest large tech company to IPO in Hong Kong, following shopping site Meituan and smartphone maker Xiaomi in 2018.

(NYSE: DM), today, Thursday, December 10, 2020, in celebration of its listing. To honor the occasion, Ric Fulop, Co-Founder and CEO, rings The Opening Bell\u00ae. NYSE\n\nRoger Lee of Battery Ventures says that \"SPAC\" used to be a \"bad four-letter word\" in Silicon Valley. Now, the board of every high-profile start-up is discussing special purpose acquisition companies as a legitimate way to go public, according to Jeff Crowe of Norwest Venture Partners. In the eyes of Lux Capital co-founder Peter Hebert, SPACs are \"stealing from the 2021 IPO calendar.\" \"We have encouraged our highest-quality companies to seriously consider this,\" said Hebert, whose firm raised its own health-tech SPAC in October and is looking for a target. \"The vast majority of companies looking at doing traditional public offerings are dual-tracking SPACs.\" Within Lux's portfolio, 3D-printing company Desktop Metal went public through a SPAC in December. Others like real estate software companies Latch and Matterport have announced deals this year with so-called blank-check companies. The sudden burst of SPACs reminds some long-timers of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. Pre-revenue businesses with far-out goals are going public at astronomical valuations, and famous athletes and other celebrities are getting in the mix. Mention the acronym to any well-known start-up CEO and you'll likely hear about the non-stop calls they receive from sponsors with hundreds of millions of dollars to spend.\n\nTo Wall Street skeptics, it looks like the finance industry's latest scheme to make money from speculators in a low interest rate environment with the market at a peak and investors hungry for all things tech. SPACs have raised more than $44 billion so far this year for 144 deals, according to SPACInsider. That's equal to more than half the money raised in all of 2020, which itself was a record year. While there's undeniable mania in the SPAC boom, there's another story playing out in parallel. Venture-backed tech companies with high-growth prospects are shunning the IPO process, which has its own flaws. Instead they're getting comfortable with the idea of hitting the market in a way that would have been unfathomable just a year ago. In a SPAC, a group of investors raise money for a shell company with no underlying business. The SPAC goes public, generally at $10 a share, and then starts hunting for a company to acquire. When it finds a target and a deal is agreed upon, the SPAC and the company pull in outside investors for what's called a PIPE, or private investment in public equity. The PIPE money goes onto the target company's balance sheet in exchange for a big equity stake. The SPAC investors get stock in the acquired company, which becomes the publicly-traded entity through what's known as the de-SPAC. One major advantage: SPACs allow companies to provide forward-looking projections, which companies typically don't do in IPO prospectuses because of liability risk. \"An IPO is what I would call backward-looking,\" said Betsy Cohen, who led a SPAC that recently took car insurer Metromile public. \"Because a SPAC is technically a merger, you're required to tell investors what the merged companies will look like after the merger and project forward.\" It's also a much faster process than the IPO, which involves spending many months with bankers and lawyers to draft a prospectus, educate the market, carry out a roadshow and build a book of institutional investors.\n\nFin-tech companies have been big SPAC targets\n\nMany of the better-known SPAC targets so far have been at the intersection of tech and financial services. For these companies, cash burn rates are high and real GAAP profits often won't come for years, even under the best circumstances.\n\nMetromile, whose technology allows drivers to pay by the mile rather than a monthly fee, started trading on Wednesday after merging with INSU Acquisition Corp. II, a SPAC led by Cohen and her son, Daniel. Chamath Palihapitiya, the venture capitalist turned mega SPAC sponsor, and billionaire Marc Cuban invested in a $160 million PIPE. As of Friday's close, the stock was trading at $17.23, giving Metromile a valuation of over $2 billion based on the fully diluted share count. \"Metromile enters the insurance market at a time when telematics are installed in virtually every car going forward, so there's the opportunity to look at insurance on an individualized customized basis, which is huge,\" Cohen said in an interview. \"We felt it was an important company to bring to the public markets and allow them to have access to capital the way insurance companies do.\" Cohen, who founded The Bancorp, said she will have closed seven SPACs by later this year, including payments company Payoneer and boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg. Metromile CEO Dan Preston told CNBC this week that around the middle of 2020, as his board was evaluating financing options, he expected to raise a large round of private capital and then go public in four to six quarters. The company had been around for a decade and raised hundreds of millions of dollars in funding.\n\nMetromile CEO Dan Preston Winni Wintermeyer\n\nOther insurance-tech businesses like Lemonade and Root held traditional IPOs last year. But Preston says the more he learned about SPACs, the more he realized it was the better approach for his company, which faced the high costs of operating in the heavily regulated insurance industry \u2014 and a pandemic that slashed the amount of miles driven. \"The sweet spot are companies that are pretty close to being public but need a little more historical data to get ready,\" said Preston. Metromile said in its merger filing that it expects insurance revenue to increase 39% to $142.1 million in 2021, and then jump 81% in 2022 and more than 100% in 2023. Adjusted gross profit will increase from $11.1 million last year to $144 million in 2023, the filing says. Online lender SoFi said in January that it was going public through a SPAC run by Palihapitiya in a deal valuing the company at $8.65 billion. In the merger agreement, SoFi projects annual revenue of $980 million this year, increasing annually to $3.7 billion in 2025, while contribution profit will more than quintuple over that stretch to $1.5 billion.\n\nIn other finance SPACs, Palihapitiya led the reverse-merger of digital real estate company Opendoor, which went public last year and is now worth over $20 billion. He did the same with health insurer Clover Health (which said this month that it's under investigation by the SEC) and is leading the PIPE for solar financing provider Sunlight Financial.\n\nTop-tier investors joining the fray\n\nHe's also doing software deals. In January, Palihapitiya was a PIPE investor in Latch, a developer of smart lock systems sold to real estate companies. Latch generates recurring software sales and said 2020 booked revenue jumped 49% from the prior year to $167 million. Blackrock, Fidelity and Wellington are also part of the PIPE, meaning they'll be equity holders when Latch goes public. Those names, viewed as top-tier public market investors, are becoming familiar to SPACs, with at least one of them showing up in the PIPE for SoFi, Matterport, Opendoor and consumer genetics company 23andMe. For companies that can attract investors of that caliber, and have sponsors they trust to stick with them through the ups and downs of the journey, a SPAC can be the most efficient way to raise money. Large private rounds typically require hefty dilution, while IPOs often come with a discount of 50% to 100% for new investors. In a SPAC, the target ends up handing up to 20% of shares to the sponsors and additional stock to PIPE investors. The rest primarily remains with insiders. When public, the company has the ability to raise follow-on capital at market rates. For example, Opendoor just announced it's raising $770 million at $27 a share, marking an increase in valuation of about 200% from the time of the PIPE investment. Norwest's Crowe, whose firm was a venture investor in Opendoor and online therapy provider Talkspace, another SPAC target, said that pricing is favorable for the best companies because there are so many SPACs going after them. \"Pricing is nuts,\" Crowe said. \"There's enormous pent-up demand for all these companies. A lot of companies that would've gone public in a relatively even fashion over 2021 and '22, if markets hold, now are all going out in a mad rush.\" Venture investors are jumping in as well. In addition to Lux, firms including FirstMark Capital, Ribbit Capital, Khosla Ventures and SoftBank have raised their own SPACs. Separate from their firms, venture capitalists Steve Case, Reid Hoffman and Bradley Tusk have followed Palihapitiya into the SPAC sponsor arena. Growth stage venture firm G Squared announced this week the close of a $345 million SPAC. Founder Larry Aschebrook, in an interview, called it \"just another tool in our toolbox\" to help companies access capital. He said it can be a good option for a CEO who's ready to run a public company and a business that's raised a lot of money in the past and can benefit from ready access to the capital markets.\n\nG Squared Ascend I Inc.

Robert Nickelsberg | Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 The SPAC craze is starting to gain some momentum in Europe. After a banner year for so-called special purpose acquisition companies in the U.S., a growing number of blank-check firms are raising funds with the intention of snapping up a European tech company. SPACs are shell companies that are created with the sole purpose of raising funds to acquire an existing private company, so that the target firm can bypass the traditional initial public offering (IPO) process. These blank-check companies raised a total of $78.2 billion across 244 IPOs in the U.S. last year, according to data from Refinitiv. The U.S. SPAC mania continued into 2021, with another 134 firms raising nearly $39 billion since the start of the year. The attraction of SPACs is that they offer a way for companies to fast-track a stock market listing. An IPO can be a much longer process, and some firms are eschewing the traditional route to avoid potential swings in market sentiment. IPOs have also attracted criticism from venture capitalists like Ben Gurley, who worry they are being underpriced. SPACs provide an alternative to IPOs, as well as direct listings where firms sell existing shares to public market investors. They often attract high-growth tech firms. Last year, U.K. electric vehicle maker Arrival announced a deal to go public via a merger with a U.S. blank-check firm.\n\nMostly a U.S. phenomenon\n\nEurope has largely missed out on the SPAC boom. Just three SPACs listed in Europe last year, netting $495 million. And not a single SPAC has debuted in the continent so far this year.\n\nSPACs aren't a new phenomenon, but they flourished in the U.S. in 2020. Investors' funds are held in a trust account after a SPAC completes its IPO, and shareholders can vote against the deal if they don't agree with it and get their money back. Industry insiders say that SPACs tend to be structured differently in the U.S. compared to Europe. And Europe is home to far fewer publicly-listed tech companies than America, which makes it harder for investors and analysts to make comparisons and benchmark firms in the sector. London's stock exchange is looking to lure more SPACs and has contacted law firms and banks to see if they can facilitate the listing of such vehicles, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC. The person preferred to remain anonymous as the talks haven't been made public. Meanwhile, the U.K. has launched a review into its listings rules in a bid to attract more tech firms to the market. Europe as a whole had a markedly quiet year in terms of tech IPOs last year, whereas the U.S. saw a flurry of major debuts from the likes of DoorDash and Airbnb. \"Unfortunately in Europe, interesting and attractive companies don't have the same access to capital as they do in the U.S., either in the private domain, nor on the public markets,\" Makram Azar, CEO of Golden Falcon Acquisition Corp, a SPAC focused on European tech, told CNBC's \"Street Signs Europe\" Friday. \"The venture capital pool of money for example is much smaller in Europe than it is in the U.S. and the IPO market is very weak.\"\n\nDeals in the works\n\nAn increasing number of blank-check firms are listing in New York with an aim to buy a European tech firm. Azar, the former chairman of banking for Europe at Barclays, raised $345 million for his SPAC in an IPO in December.

Getty\n\nLONDON \u2014 The European Innovation Council has encountered some early setbacks but is now headed in the right direction, according to a vice chair of the advisory board Hermann Hauser, who became a venture capitalist after helping to set up chip designer Arm. The EIC has been given 10 billion euros ($12 billion) to invest in European start-ups between 2021 and 2027 as part of the EU's Horizon initiative. It will invest up to 15 million euros in a particular start-up in exchange for a maximum stake of 10-25%. \"I never thought Brussels would go for this but we are allowed to do equity investments, and this is unbelievable,\" Hauser told CNBC from his farm in New Zealand, where he has been stuck since last March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. \"This is beginning,\" said Hauser, who wants to see the money invested in companies focusing on AI, machine learning, quantum computing, and blockchain technologies. \"We've got start-up problems and I wouldn't say that it's a perfectly smooth machine, but it's beginning to work quite well.\" Hauser said the EIC's start-up problems existed because it had delays in setting up all the necessary procedures. The fund's 10 billion euro budget was confirmed in December following a four-year pilot that saw 2 billion euros invested. The EIC was set up by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, to try to help start-ups across Europe to scale up and compete with rivals in the U.S. and Asia, which have spawned several tech giants with market caps that run well into hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nIn the U.S. there's Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and so on. In China there's Huawei, Alibaba, Baidu, and others. In Europe, there's a handful of tech companies valued in the tens of billions \u2014 think Adyen, Spotify and Arm \u2014 and next to none valued at over $100 billion, except SAP and ASML. European politicians have also expressed a desire to start sourcing more essential digital services from European companies as opposed to foreign ones.\n\nTurning start-ups into scale-ups\n\n\"Europe doesn't have a start-up problem,\" said Hauser, who is also a venture partner in Amadeus Capital in Cambridge. \"We produce more start-ups than the U.S. Europe has a scale-up problem and a deep tech finance problem. Both of which are addressed by the EIC.\" So far, the EIC has made 48 investments, spending 180 million euros in the process, according to Hauser. One recipient, French start-up CorWave, is developing pumps that can help people with heart failure.\n\nHowever, some tech investors and entrepreneurs raised concerns that Brussels doesn't know how to spot, support and invest in promising start-ups. Hauser said he had similar concerns: \"Of course, the thing that I was immediately worried about was \u2026 don't let the Brussels guys decide who to invest in or not,\" he said. To get around this issue, Hauser introduced a rule that means the EIC fund can only invest in a start-up's funding round when the majority of the money is coming from private investors. \"It needs the VC community because it's not allowed to make any investment unless the majority of the money comes from the market,\" he said. Hauser said the EIC also has the advantage of being so close to the well-established European Research Council, which he thinks has backed some of the best tech projects in Europe. \"So in terms of the technical due diligence, I think we actually have something to bring to the party for the VCs,\" he said.\n\nBiggest deep tech fund in Europe", "meta_img": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106701239-1600087219241-GettyImages-953984286.jpg?v=1613127178"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9986395239830017}, "keywords": ["Business", "Start-up", "Investment strategy", "Venture capital", "Technology", "business news"], "summary": "The EIC has been given 10 billion euros ( $ 12 billion ) to invest in European start - ups between 2021 and 2027 as part of the EU 's Horizon initiative.

The administration is also consulting with business leaders, along with lawmakers and other stakeholders, to find ways to potentially improve the legislation, the White House official said. The discussions have focused on various aspects of the plan, including its overall price tag, direct $1,400 payments to Americans and the prospect of raising the federal minimum wage, the official added. The administration has also sought feedback from executives on how they have handled the pandemic. Some of the leaders with whom the White House has engaged are opposed to certain aspects of Biden's plan. Departing U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO Tom Donohue, who met with Biden on Tuesday, has cautioned against raising the minimum wage to $15. The raising of the minimum wage is part of Biden's Covid relief plan. The chamber has said it supports Biden's overall proposal for taking on the coronavirus pandemic. Sixty-three percent of small business owners support the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package, according to the latest quarterly CNBC|SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey. Biden himself has started meeting with top-tier executives about the proposal and future policy plans.

Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty Images\n\nStill, the star-studded cast of American industry is likely to press the White House on its plans for making more Covid-19 vaccines available for workers, the size, scope and importance of another round of stimulus checks, and how a $15 minimum wage would impact payrolls. Yellen, a former chair of the Federal Reserve, has stressed the importance of acting quickly to flush the U.S. economy with more fiscal support even after the $900 billion bill Congress passed in December. Without it, the labor market recovery could take years instead of a complete rebound by next year, she said over the weekend. Though the U.S. economy rebounded sharply in summer 2020, that progress has plateaued if not partially reversed this winter as the hospitality, travel and food service industries continue to struggle under the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The January 2021 jobs report, published Friday, showed that employers added only 49,000 jobs last month. The drop in the unemployment rate, which fell to 6.3% from 6.7%, came as more people gave up on their job searches. It's statistics like those which have hastened efforts by congressional Democrats to pass Biden's American Rescue Plan using a budget tool known as reconciliation that would allow the party to muscle the big-ticket plan through Capitol Hill without support from the GOP. Though the Biden administration for weeks voiced optimism that his plan could pass on a bipartisan basis with the 60 votes required without reconciliation, Republican pushback over the size of the bill appears to have ended prospects for an agreeable solution. \"The president \u2013 his first priority is getting relief to the American people,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. \"Again, I don't think the American people are particularly worried about how the direct relief gets into their hands. If [reconciliation] is the process it moves forward through, which seems likely at this point, the president would certainly support that.\"\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden receives an economic briefing with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, January 29, 2021.

The airline is joining other investors backing Archer, a start-up developing electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. If Archer can get its eVTOL certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, it expects to deliver the first aircraft in 2024. \"It's pretty incredible to think how big this market can be,\" Archer co-founder and co-CEO Adam Goldstein said. \"The partnership with United really gives us a chance to get to market first and really helps us accelerate our timeline.\" Palo Alto, California-based Archer, which was founded three years ago, will unveil its first full-scale eVTOL aircraft later this year. The company also plans to develop and manufacture the battery pack that will power the aircraft. Archer said its piloted eVTOL is designed to carry as many as four passengers up to 60 miles at speeds that could reach 150 mph.\n\nArcher Air Source: Archer Air\n\nTo go from concept to certified aircraft, Archer is raising $1.1 billion through a SPAC merger with Atlas Crest Investment Corp. The merger is valued at $3.8 billion. Among those backing the deal, two firms stand out: Stellantis and United Airlines. Stellantis, the new name for the recently merged companies of PSA Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler, is working with Archer to manufacture the carbon-fiber fuselage of the eVTOL aircraft. United has placed a $1 billion order for 200 Archer eVTOL aircraft, with an option to purchase 100 more for $500 million. \"By working with Archer, United is showing the aviation industry that now is the time to embrace cleaner, more efficient modes of transportation,\" United CEO Scott Kirby said in a release announcing the Archer SPAC. Investing in clean initiatives has become part of Kirby's strategy to cut United's carbon footprint. In December, the airline announced a multimillion-dollar investment in a carbon-capture joint venture.\n\nArcher Air Source: Archer Air\n\nUnited estimates passengers making the 13-mile trip from Hollywood to Los Angeles International Airport in an Archer eVTOL aircraft could reduce CO2 emissions by 50%. \"Archer's eVTOL design, manufacturing model and engineering expertise has the clear potential to change how people commute within major metropolitan cities all over the world,\" said Kirby. The eVTOL market has exploded in recent years, with Deloitte estimating 200 companies worldwide are developing aircraft. Many are for cargo operations and others focus on passenger travel, which is expected to be a $4 billion market by 2025 and $57 billion by 2035, according to Deloitte. In December, California-based Joby bought Uber Elevate with plans to have eVTOL aircraft entering service as soon as 2024. In a research note last month, Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said the urban air-mobility market will likely start as a niche service but \"could later transform into a cost-effective, time-efficient method of traveling short to medium distances, eventually taking share from car and airline companies.\"\n\nArcher Air Source: Archer Air", "meta_img": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106838280-1612959024891ArcherAir1-jpg?v=1612964423"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9808666110038757}, "keywords": ["SPAC", "Scott Kirby", "United Airlines Holdings Inc", "Stellantis NV", "Transportation", "Airlines", "Business", "Travel", "Breaking News: Business", "Atlas Crest Investment Corp", "business news"], "summary": "If Archer can get its eVTOL certified by the Federal Aviation Administration , it expects to deliver the first aircraft in 2024 \". \n\n Archer Air Source : Archer Air \n\n To go from concept to certified aircraft , Archer is raising $ 1.1 billion through a SPAC merger with Atlas Crest Investment Corp.

As vaccinations are opening borders to some countries, Covid mutations are causing others to close. The volatile nature of the pandemic's current stage is a reminder to travel-starved holidaymakers that the risks of traveling right now extend beyond contracting Covid-19. On Jan. 29, the French government suspended tourism to its overseas territories and collectivities, which includes French Polynesia in the South Pacific Ocean, Saint Martin in the Caribbean and Saint Pierre and Miquelon near eastern Canada. Only visitors with \"compelling reasons\" related to professional, health, personal or family concerns will be allowed to visit French Polynesia from Feb. 3, according to the country's state services' website. Those able to enter will be subject to 14-day quarantines. The sudden restrictions, which are part of a wider effort by France to tighten its borders, are a result of new Covid variants that are emerging across the world.\n\nVariants are 'massively affecting' the world\n\nThe decision to close French Polynesia's borders was \"motivated by an obligation of health prevention in the face of the threat of Covid variants which are gradually and massively affecting our planet,\" according to a press release on Tahiti's tourism website.\n\nFrench Polynesia is home to the popular islands of Tahiti and Bora Bora. M Swiet Productions | Moment | Getty Images\n\nSummarizing key points in a speech made by French Polynesian President Edouard Fritch, the press release said: \"Faced with this new wave of the pandemic, we must once again take our responsibilities. We must protect ourselves to save the lives of the most vulnerable.\" Although thousands of Covid variants have been identified, new strains first identified in South Africa, Brazil and the U.K. are more transmissible than previous ones. Concerns that current vaccines may be less effective against them have dampened the excitement surrounding the global vaccine rollout that began in December 2020. On Sunday, South Africa stopped issuing the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine after clinical trials showed it was not protecting trial participants from becoming mildly to moderately ill from the more contagious variant found there.\n\n'Safe' travel in a pandemic\n\nFrench Polynesia announced the tourism suspension on the same day that a travel article in Men's Journal declared that \"Right now is the perfect time to visit Tahiti.\" The story said that Tahiti, the largest and most developed of the country's 118 islands and atolls, is \"safe\" and \"empty\" of tourists.\n\nWe will not reach true reduced risk of travel until we achieve herd immunity. Harry Severance Duke University School of Medicine\n\nHome to around 280,000 people, French Polynesia has confirmed more than 18,000 cases of Covid-19 to date, including 333 new cases in the past two weeks. While infection rates have declined since last November, when 1,384 cases were confirmed in a single day, French Polynesia is still battling active outbreaks that began after it ended quarantine requirements for incoming visitors last July. Travelers must also avoid infections in airports to get there, and in the case of Tahiti, the journey may include long-haul flights that range from 8.5 hours from San Francisco and Sydney, to 16.5 hours from New York and nearly a full day of flying from London. \"We will not reach true reduced risk of travel until we achieve herd immunity,\" said Harry Severance, an adjunct assistant professor at Duke University School of Medicine. Until that time, he said travelers would be safest to travel under a \"two-factor system\" that includes a vaccination coupled with a recent negative Covid antigen test. \"Even that is not 100%, but will be close to it,\" he said.\n\nAnother risk: Sudden cancellations\n\nSeverance said that due to \"Covid fatigue\" \u2014 or the mental burnout caused by worrying about and being restricted by Covid-19 \u2014 people are \"demonstrating that they are now willing to accept increased risk and are now increasingly traveling on vacations, family meetings and other such ventures.\" For that reason, travelers may need to face the potential for sudden cancellations, which can happen with little to no warning. Tahiti Tourisme announced the tourist suspension to French Polynesia on Feb. 1; the restrictions went into effect on Feb. 3. \"We are still in a pandemic and the conditions are unpredictable and can change rapidly,\" said Karen L. Edwards, chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine. Travelers in French Polynesia who were scheduled to return last week were able to end their stays as planned. Beyond that, Tahiti Tourisme advised travelers \"to contact your airline.\" French Polynesia indicated it will ask that the French government impose the shutdown for no more than two months. A letter dated Feb. 2 from Nils DuFau, the president of St. Barts' tourism board, was more pointed. \"St. Barts' authorities are right now negotiating with the French government to ease the entry restrictions and find an alternative solution,\" he wrote. \"Our aim is to reopen the island's borders as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe temptation of 'empty' tourist destinations\n\nThe pandemic has largely remedied one age-old travel complaint \u2014 overcrowding. Famous tourist sites and popular destinations are welcoming far fewer travelers \u2014 a fact which is now being put forth as a reason to visit them.\n\nTourist closures to French Polynesia and other French territories are expected to last two to three months.

Record breaking infection rates in recent weeks have forced Dubai to introduce new venue capacity cuts and a night curfew for some businesses, after opening itself to tourists. Authorities blamed \"a marked increase in the number of violations of precautionary measures\" for the new rules. In the last week, the U.K. has suspended all UAE flights \u2014 the world's busiest international route. Meanwhile, Dubai on Wednesday banned its popular brunches, closing pubs and bars. \"The approach in the UAE and in Dubai in particular has always been underpinned by science, and science informed common sense,\" Alawi Alsheikh-Ali, deputy director of the Dubai Health Authority told CNBC's Hadley Gamble on Thursday. \"The numbers have surged but the health system has managed to keep up with the numbers and take care of the sick, and there has been more restrictions now in terms of activities in the Emirate and the UAE in response to that,\" he added. But as images of busy beaches and Instagram celebrities on social media spark anger and envy in the international press, some are questioning the wisdom of Dubai's strategy.\n\n\n\n\"What has happened in Dubai did not need to happen,\" Erin Bromage, a professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, who specializes in infection and immunology, told CNBC.\n\n\n\n\"They have brought the virus in, including the new variants, in waves of new tourists and allowed it to spread through the community as well as spread to uninfected tourists,\" Bromage said. \"The tourists return home and seeded infections there, possibly with the new variants.\"\n\nTravel hotspot\n\nFigures from the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority show almost 300,000 people traveled between the U.K. and UAE during November and December last year alone, with thousands flocking to Dubai's hotspots for an escape from lockdowns.\n\nIn the critical month of December \u2014 when a new and highly transmissible variant of the virus was spreading in the U.K. \u2014 211,115 people traveled between the U.K. and the UAE. The data only shows traffic to and from the U.K. and not other countries, meaning the total number of travelers is likely much higher. Testing was required for passengers before boarding or on arrival. \"We've been following the numbers very carefully, and we're very concerned by the rise in numbers and the emergence of new variants about two months ago,\" Alsheikh-Ali said. Cases have tripled since November, but UAE authorities deny the community has been put at risk and reject the idea that the city has become a hotspot for spreading the virus abroad. \"We've seen variants \u2026 reported now in more than 70 different countries,\" Alsheikh-Ali said. \"I don't think it's helpful to identify a particular country as a particular source for a certain variant,\" he added. Dubai's business community, who benefited from the open door policy, is also pushing back. \"The infection rates are much higher in the U.K. than they currently are in the UAE, so making the case that somehow the UAE is causing issues or is a superspreader country is clearly not the case,\" Chris Payne, chief economist of Dubai-based Peninsula Real Estate, told CNBC.\n\n\"The UAE have taken a different track, Dubai specifically, and I don't blame them for that,\" Payne added. \"They've taken the view that the economy of Dubai needed to open, and it couldn't withstand the kind of prolonged closures that we've seen elsewhere in the world.\" There were 3,310 new coronavirus cases recorded in the UAE on Wednesday, up from 2,730 on Tuesday, according to official data from Johns Hopkins University. The UAE seven day-average case count stands at 3,500.\n\nSpreading abroad\n\nAs debate rages over Dubai's virus strategy, at least two countries have raised concern about passenger flows in recent weeks. Danish Transport Minister Benny Engelbrecht said at least \"one citizen\" brought the South African variant of the virus \"back from Dubai.\" Denmark has temporarily banned flights from the UAE amid criticism over Emirati testing facilities.\n\nA mask-clad Israeli tourist in the historic al-Fahidi neighborhood of Dubai on January 11, 2021. As much of the world tightens lockdowns amid COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, Dubai remains open for tourism, branding itself as a sunny, quarantine-free escape -- despite a sharp rise in cases. KARIM SAHIB | AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe UAE has one of the highest per capita testing rates in the world, with the total number of tests exceeding 26 million to date. Authorities said testing centers operate by international standards and are inspected regularly. Concern has also come from Israel, where more than 900 travelers returning from Dubai have been infected with coronavirus, according to a report in the Associated Press citing the Israeli military. It said returnees \"created a chain of infections numbering more than 4,000 people.\" CNBC was not able to independently verify the report and has contacted the Israeli military for comment.\n\nDespite the claims, UAE authorities insist they are taking effective action to protect the safety of those living in and visiting the UAE. That also includes frontline health care workers dealing with the rising cases. \"It's not a good idea, but life must go on,\" one medical worker who was conducting PCR tests in the financial area told CNBC when asked if Dubai should stay open to travelers. \"We just need to be responsible and take care. I've taken my vaccine,\" the worker, who preferred to remain anonymous as they were not confident speaking publicly without employer authorization, said.\n\nPeople wait their turn to get vaccinated against the coronavirus at a vaccination center set up at the Dubai International Financial Center in the Gulf emirate of Dubai, on February 3, 2021. The UAE has administered at least three million doses to more than a quarter of its population. 1230948336\n\nAuthorities also dismissed suggestions of a shortage of hospital beds in Dubai. \"The health system here in Dubai has been able to stay ahead of the curve with surge capacity.

The best croissant in the world, according to many, including the good folks at The New York Times, may be in Melbourne. Kate Reid studied the art of making croissants at Du Pain et des Idees, the popular Parisian boulangerie. After much trial and error adjusting recipes to allow for local ingredients, the self-confessed control freak \u2014 Kate's an engineer who used to design race cars \u2014 mastered the art before opening Lune Croissanterie.\n\nThe coconut rough croissant at Lune Croissanterie. Jana Langhorst\n\nNow, carb-scoffing visitors to this warehouse space in Fitzroy can watch as her bakers laminate, egg-wash and proof the pastries in a climate-controlled glass cube. A dozen varieties are made each day, but firm favorites include the cruffin \u2014 a cross between a croissant and a muffin \u2014 and the twice-baked croissant. The flavors of the latter change regularly, but the coconut rough croissant, with its rich ganache and toasted coconut flakes, is also popular.\n\nNot your average dumpling\n\nFans of Cantonese cuisine are likely familiar with siu mai, a delicate steamed dumpling commonly filled with pork and prawn. During the 1940s, siu mai was adapted to suit the palates of the Melbourne populace. The result lives on in a distinct new dumpling, now known as a dim sim (yes \"sim,\" not \"sum\") or simply \"a dimmy\" as it's known in Melbourne.\n\nA \"dimmy\" at South Melbourne Market Dim Sims. Courtesy of South Melbourne Market.\n\nThose bigger parcels with thicker skin were perfected by Ken Cheng, who set up a stall in the South Melbourne Market many years ago. His round morsels were filled with beef, pork, lamb, cabbage and spices, and they haven't changed much since Cheng began selling them in 1949. His sons, Edward and Phillip, now run South Melbourne Market Dim Sims, where they sell their dad's dumplings as well a popular fried version too. How best to eat them? With your fingers and dipped in a little soy sauce and chili.\n\nLove the black stuff\n\nIn 2018, two weeks before he opened his Southeast Asian restaurant Sunda, chef Khanh Nguyen decided he should put a roti dish on the menu. The buttery Indian flatbread is usually served with a bowlful of traditional curry. But Nguyen had another idea. \"The idea of Vegemite curry came up when I was talking about bread with a colleague,\" said Nguyen, referencing the thick salty spread that is beloved by Australians. \"The word yeast came to mind, then Vegemite popped into my head.\"\n\nSunda's buttery roti is served alongside a paste-like 'curry' laced with Vegemite. Ryan Noreiks\n\nNguyen was excited about it, but no one he told believed it would work. \"My first version of it tasted so weird!\" said Nguyen. \"I had sleepless nights and changed the recipe a few times, then it eventually turned out to be what it is today.\" Now the delicately spiced, umami-intense dish is one of the most popular items at the restaurant. \"Diners are usually quite skeptical about it at first,\" said Nguyen. \"Then they end up loving it.\" The dish is now served as a \"special\" at Sunda, and Nguyen estimates he's served it over 15,000 times since opening his restaurant.\n\nSlam it down\n\nIn Australia, a pie is generally thought of as a snack you eat at a sporting event. They're hot, filled with minced meat and gravy, and always served with a packet of \"tomato sauce,\" the Australian term for ketchup. Chef Raymond Capaldi has taken them to another level at Wonder Pies, which has several locations in Melbourne including the popular Collingwood outlet. \"I realized everyone was doing the same sort of pie, so I thought I could come up with new flavors,\" he said. He observes food trends and incorporates them into flaky pastry perfection. There's macaroni and Cheezel pie (macaroni, vintage cheddar and mustard topped with Cheezels crumbs, an Australian snack similar to Cheetos) and one filled with duck confit and coffee sauce.\n\nNot to be confused with a hamburger, Wonder Pies' Tradie Slammer is a beef pie served between two brioche buns, served with house-made chutney. Courtesy of Wonder Pies\n\n\"We push the boundaries without being too Frankenstein for the market,\" said Capaldi. The Tradie Slammer is another surprise hit at Wonder Pies. Available during Australia's winter months (June to August), it's a pie in a brioche bun served with house-made chutney \u2014 a creative tip of the hat to Capaldi's Scottish background. \"When we had no money in Scotland, we used to put a pie in a roll \u2014 and it would last us half the day,\" he said.\n\nFreshwater wonders\n\nOne of the most sought-after tables in Melbourne, if not all of Australia, Chef Ben Shewry's Attica is touted as Australia's finest dining experience. The restaurant is known for its innovative tasting menu, which is stacked with native ingredients like kangaroo, crocodile, saltbrush and murnong (an Australian yam).\n\nAttica's grilled marron, a crayfish found in Western Australia, with desert lime.

The move is a significant change in direction for a country whose economy relies heavily on expatriates, for whom residency is typically contingent on their employment visas. The UAE passport, which is ranked as one of the best in the world for mobility, will be offered to select foreigners and professionals including \"investors, doctors, specialists, inventors, scientists, talents, intellectuals, artists and their families,\" according to the announcement. \"The United Arab Emirates has approved amendments ... allowing investors, professionals, special talents and their families to acquire the Emirati nationality and passport under certain conditions,\" the UAE government news agency WAM said in a release Saturday. \"The step aims at appreciating the talents and competencies present in the UAE and attracting more bright minds to the Emirati community in a way that contributes to the development and prosperity of the country.\" Foreigners cannot apply for citizenship, however; they must be nominated by UAE royals or officials, and the country's Cabinet would get the final say.\n\nA sunbather watches as people play during a beach volleyball tournament in the Gulf emirate of Dubai on July 24, 2020. KARIM SAHIB | AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe announcement, which has no precedent in the Gulf region, reflects how the small Arab sheikhdom aims to retain top talent as the coronavirus pandemic forced tens of thousands of expats to leave in the last year. Nearly 90% of the UAE's roughly 10 million inhabitants are foreign nationals. While many specific details of the new policy are yet to be seen, this is a big deal for the UAE's future, says Taufiq Rahim, a Dubai-based senior fellow in the international security program at the New America think tank. \"The pathway to citizenship for expatriates while limited in scope and unclear in details today, is a transformative development for the future,\" Rahim told CNBC. \"The announcement broke the barrier on an issue that was previously taboo and in the long-term will spur greater investment in the UAE.\"\n\n\n\nHe added, \"In the short-term, however, it is more a feel good story than a driver of economic returns.\"\n\nA series of foreigner-friendly reforms\n\nA major step forward in domestic policy, the move follows several months of historic reforms and diplomatic breakthroughs for the Middle Eastern trading and business hub. In August, the UAE became the first Gulf country to normalize relations and open direct flights with Israel. In the following months, the officially Muslim country introduced reforms legalizing cohabitation, allowing alcohol buying without a license, and permitting 100% foreign business ownership, compared with previous requirements of 51% local ownership when based outside of a free zone.\n\nForeign UAE residents typically have renewable visas tied to their employment that must be renewed every three years. This means they have little incentive to invest in the country long term, and are deterred from investing in areas like property, an important pillar of the country's economy. \"The model for expatriates used to be 'let's make as much as we can from this country then move home,'\" said Karim Jetha, chief investment officer at Longdean Capital, an emerging markets asset management firm. \"The new mindset the government is trying to inspire is 'if you give as much as you can to this country, you can call it your home.'\"\n\nGreater incentives for investing\n\nThe UAE government in late 2020 expanded its already existing \"golden\" visa program, which grants 10-year residency to certain professionals and degree holders. It also introduced five-year retirement visas for people above a certain income level. Most recently, it introduced a remote worker visa allowing one-year stays for people with employment overseas, granted they meet a salary requirement. But citizenship would enable a permanent stake in the country, expanding the population of willing investors. Investors desiring citizenship are required to own property in the UAE, for example. \"The decision to grant citizenship is the latest in a series of moves by the UAE government to make society more inclusive and encourage longer-term stays by expatriates,\" Jetha said.", "meta_img": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106833355-1612202204307-gettyimages-1186846450-uaepassportinbag.jpeg?v=1612202245"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.99886554479599}, "keywords": ["United Arab Emirates", "Emerging markets", "Politics", "Travel", "Citizenship", "Investment strategy", "business news"], "summary": "Umar Shariff Photography \n\n DUBAI , United Arab Emirates \u2014 The United Arab Emirates announced that Emirati nationality will now be officially attainable for foreigners , in a major first for the Gulf state.

It's believed to be one of the most photographed places in Kyoto, and perhaps one of its most photographically enhanced, too.\n\nArashiyama Bamboo Grove Chanchai Duangdoosan | EyeEm | Getty Images\n\nThe internet is replete with photos of the paved walkway that runs through the 6 square mile grove. These photos are eerily similar, saturated with brilliant shades of greens and golds \u2014 even at night \u2014 and typically include just one person, if any at all. Some photographs show a woman dressed in a yukata, a casual version of a kimono, walking with a parasol in total solitude. Stunning? Definitely. However, this is not the experience most travelers should expect. Though reviews are positive \u2014 the forest gets 4.5 out of five stars on TripAdvisor's traveler ratings \u2014 Arashiyama Bamboo Grove is rarely as quiet as photos suggest. \"Although it was raining and there were a lot of people,\" said a recent TripAdvisor review, which added that \"the whole experience was very enjoyable.\" Another was more blunt, stating: \"Let's be clear, it's a nice place. But most of the time, you will not enjoy a peaceful stroll in a bamboo grove, feeling like you traveled the old days of the samurai. Instead, you will be surrounded by Instagram photo-snapping tourists \u2026 and most yukata-wearing girls you'll see will be tourists.\"\n\nUsually there are people on the forest path \u2014 even at night \u2014but there are ways to remove them from photographs. L: Aldo Pavan | The Image Bank | Getty Images; R: Cheng Feng Chiang | iStock | Getty Images\n\nIt's possible to walk the forest path in as few as 20 to 30 minutes, said American Constance Hsia. But, she told CNBC's Global Traveler, those \"who plan to take professional photos or want to post glamour shots on Instagram\" could easily spend an hour or more. She has visited Arashiyama twice, both times to see Kyoto's famous foliage in autumn which, along with the cherry blossoms in the spring, are the busiest times to visit. \"I have been told that the gardens are beautiful year-round because the summer is very green and the winter snow is stunning too,\" she said. \"It's likely Arashiyama will be crowded during every season because it will be on every tourist's list of things to see in Kyoto.\"\n\nA photo of Arashiyama Bamboo Grove without the path. Westend61 | Westend61 | Getty Images\n\nApproximately 4.94 million tourists visited Kyoto in November 2019, the highest monthly total for the year, according to data company Statista. Around six weeks later, Japan recorded its first case of coronavirus, which led to a new problem for the perpetually crowded city: undertourism.\n\nHow photos of the forest are edited\n\nPhotos on Instagram of Arashiyama Bamboo Grove range from emerald green to ashy gray, and even a pale baby blue. A representative of the Japan National Tourism Organization told Global Traveler that the forest is \"usually green all year round, even in winter\" and that blue and gray shades \"could be due to other lightings or photographic filters [or] effects.\" Editing eye-popping photos of the bamboo grove requires both camera and computer skills. Travel blogger and photographer Augustus Woods posted a 42-minute tutorial on YouTube explaining how to enhance images of the forest using Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop. In the video, Woods explains how he uses a process called \"masking\" to remove people from the shot, and \"cloning\" to add details back in. He describes in the video how he added a missing patch of thatch, removed a \"distracting\" leaning bamboo stalk, boosted the color of the bamboo, and adjusted the slant of the stalks. At the end, Woods has transformed a series of dark shots with strangers into a single spectacular photo of the forest.\n\nWhat Arashiyama Bamboo Grove really looks like\n\nThere are websites that show more realistic depictions of Arashiyama Bamboo Grove. And photos posted on travel review sites may be a good way to temper travel expectations.\n\nAn unretouched photo of Arashiyama Bamboo Forest.

Editing can more closely show what the photographer saw in real life, particularly for landscape photography, writes Dutch photographer Albert Dros on the photography website PetaPixel. Anyone who has struggled to take a good shot of a sunset or rainbow knows the camera doesn't always capture the full extent of nature's beauty.\n\nTourists visit Arashiyama Bamboo Grove in Arashiyama, Kyoto prefecture Dec. 8, 2018 Behrouz Mehri | AFP | Getty Images\n\nExtreme editing, or \"post-processing,\" is different.

But daily record-hitting Covid-19 infections in the Middle East's commercial and holiday hub have made chatter of a potential new lockdown unavoidable. \"It's getting really bad. How long did they think they could get away with this?\" Farah S., a lawyer working in Dubai, told CNBC. New cases recorded on Tuesday reached an all-time daily high for the country at 3,601, according to the UAE's Ministry of Health. When the country imposed its strictest lockdown in March and April that saw stay-at-home orders and total border closures, daily cases were less than one-tenth of that figure.\n\nThe UAE, along with scores of other countries, has been put under the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's \"Level 4\" risk level, the highest category of Covid-19 risk on its ranking. \"Travelers should avoid all travel to the United Arab Emirates,\" the CDC's Traveler's Health page for the country read. Just last week, the desert emirate of 3.3 million \u2014 whose economy relies heavily on tourism and hospitality \u2014 had begun making changes that belie the government's messaging that everything is under control. On Jan. 21, authorities directed all Dubai hospitals to suspend non-essential surgeries for a month. Around the same time, a directive went out suspending all \"entertainment activities\" in restaurants and bars. The cap on weddings, social events and private parties has been cut to 10 people from 30. Restaurants and cafes, from Jan. 27 onward, will require increased space between tables and less people per table. Customers and equipment in gyms must now be spaced 3 meters apart as opposed to the prior 2 meters, though that 2-meter requirement was often not very judiciously applied in the first place. Per capita cases in the UAE are still lower than in the U.S., Israel, the U.K. and much of Europe, but they are significantly higher than in neighboring Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia or Oman.\n\nA mask-clad Israeli tourist in the historic al-Fahidi neighborhood of Dubai on January 11, 2021.

KARIM SAHIB | AFP via Getty Images\n\nDubai on Sunday fired the head of its health department, replacing Humaid al-Qutami, who had held the post since 2018, with a new appointee. Authorities did not give a reason for the replacement and did not reply to CNBC's request for comment. Some Dubai residents have claimed that hospitals are running out of ICU beds, though this could not be confirmed as hospitals and health authorities did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment. But over the weekend, the UAE's health ministry published a post on its Instagram story headed with the words \"URGENT HIRING\", offering temporary contracts for ICU nurses in Dubai as well as the emirates of Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah. This came just days after the order to halt non-essential surgeries. To date, the UAE's total confirmed cases count at 281,546, with 798 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Its death rate of 0.3% is significantly below the global average.\n\nA 2020 'safe travel' haven\n\nAfter keeping its cases well below 2,000 per day for all of 2020, Dubai emirate \u2014 which adopted a strategy of openness in contrast to the UAE's more conservative capital Abu Dhabi \u2014 billed itself as a pandemic success story. It was certified as a \"Safe Travel\" destination by the World Tourism Council last summer, drawing celebrities and influencers. Hotels and theme parks saw jumps in occupancy and tourists from all over the world flocked to Dubai for a sense of much-missed normality. Mask-wearing remained ubiquitous and testing is widely available.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo attends the Dubai Globe Soccer Awards at Armani Hotel Dubai on December 27, 2020 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

But the new and highly-transmissible coronavirus variant first identified in the U.K. is suspected to have triggered the recent case spike as thousands of British tourists poured in over the holidays to escape harsh U.K. lockdown. Daily tallies have more than tripled within the span of a month since Dec. 30.\n\nWoman sunbathers sit along a beach in the Gulf emirate of Dubai on July 24, 2020, while behind is seen the Burj al-Arab hotel.

KARIM SAHIB | AFP via Getty Images\n\nAndy Pearson, a British engineer living in Dubai, blames the large volumes of tourists he believes aren't following local safety requirements. \"The police should do more checks in the party areas to make sure people are sticking to the rules,\" he said. \"Tourists don't care because they can just go home \u2014 they're ruining it for the rest of us.\" The Dubai Media Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether a lockdown was coming or what further changes would be made to combat the rise in cases.\n\nCountries put up barriers over UAE case and test concerns\n\nAnother warning signal came last Thursday when Denmark announced a five-day suspension on flights from the UAE over suspicions that the Covid tests administered to travelers before leaving Dubai weren't reliable. \"We can't ignore such a suspicion,\" Denmark's transport minister said, adding that at least one citizen returned from Dubai with the variant recently discovered in South Africa, out of several more who he said tested positive for Covid. The UAE's health ministry pushed back on the announcement, asserting that all accredited UAE testing centers operate by international standards and are inspected regularly. Talks are underway between the two countries, UAE authorities said. Earlier in the month, the U.K. and Israel imposed mandatory quarantine requirements for travelers coming from the UAE. The UAE was previously on the U.K.'s safe-travel corridor, which had voided the need for arrival quarantine periods. The Covid-19 case figures include the whole country and do not specify where infections are concentrated. But while is Dubai welcoming tourists \u2014 some requiring negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test results before boarding and others receiving tests on arrival \u2014 Abu Dhabi still requires anyone flying into the emirate to quarantine for ten days upon arrival. Entrants to Abu Dhabi from Dubai must also provide a series of negative PCR test results.\n\nNationwide vaccination push\n\nThe developments come as the UAE's nationwide vaccination campaign is in full swing, in what is the second-fastest rollout in the world after Israel. China's Sinopharm vaccine is available around the country for all residents aged 16 and older free of charge, while Dubai's Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine rollout that began in late December was announced on Saturday as being delayed. Dubai authorities blame the delay on a \"global shortage.\"", "meta_img": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106829813-1611650771157-Dubai_Burj_Khalifa_NYEGettyImages-1230372816.jpg?v=1611651271"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.5334852337837219}, "keywords": ["Entertainment", "Tourism", "COVID-19", "Middle East", "Dubai", "United Arab Emirates", "Devin Unga", "Transportation", "Travel", "Emerging markets", "Health care industry", "business news"], "summary": "New cases recorded on Tuesday reached an all - time daily high for the country at 3,601 , according to the UAE 's Ministry of Health.

Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nIn 13 years as a start-up investor, Elad Gil has backed some of the era's biggest tech breakouts, such as Airbnb, Instacart, Stripe and Square. He also co-founded genomics company Color, drawing on his Ph.D. in biology and previous work in virology labs. Late last year, before optimistic vaccine news started rolling out from Pfizer and Moderna, Gil combined his science expertise with his start-up success to scout out his next investment. He was projecting that the developed world would be mostly through the Covid-19 crisis by late 2021, so he started looking for businesses hurt by the pandemic that were poised to rebound sharply on the other side. Other than Airbnb, which was already in his portfolio, the next best bet he found was TripActions, a developer of travel and expense management software. TripActions cut hundreds of jobs in March amid a massive cutback in corporate travel. Gil, who previously worked at Google and later ran corporate strategy at Twitter, saw the company positioning itself to capture market share when the economy reopens. Gil connected with TripActions CEO Ariel Cohen through ex-Twitter COO Adam Bain, an investor in the company. Gil and Cohen met first through Zoom and then in person. Now, Gil is co-leading a $155 million financing, investing alongside Andreessen Horowitz and Addition, Lee Fixel's venture firm. \"I thought it was wise to invest while things still looked tough for travel, because it would be much more expensive to invest when things come rushing back,\" said Gil, who lives in San Francisco. \"Business travel is not going to go away.\" The funding round, announced on Thursday, values TripActions at $5 billion, up from $4 billion in mid-2019. Revenue is still down from pre-Covid days, though the company isn't providing numbers.\n\nCombining science and investing\n\nGil has been on top of Covid research since early in the pandemic. He wrote a blog post last February, titled \"Coronavirus (COVID-19) PSA for Startups,\" warning of a coming global spread and suggesting that companies \"curtail travel and conferences and move to video calls\" and \"plan for the remote work contingency.\" He has credibility on the subject. In addition to earning his doctorate in molecular biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Gil has been close to this pandemic through his work at Color, where he remains a board member. Color partnered with health diagnostics company PerkinElmer and the state of California to enable Covid testing for large populations. Even without widespread vaccinations, Gil was expecting that herd immunity would largely pass through society by early 2022. That bullishness informed his view on TripActions.\n\nTripActions CEO Ariel Cohen TripActions\n\nCohen, who co-founded TripActions in 2015, said the increased valuation is a reflection of signing on new customers in recent months and the traction the company is seeing from new products. In February, TripActions introduced a payments product called Liquid that allows customers to sync employee business travel purchases with a back-end system for reporting expenses and handling compliance and analytics. It's like combining an American Express card (TripActions provides its own card) and Concur software, removing the manual burden for employees. TripActions also expanded beyond travel into broader expense management, which has become more important with people working remotely and bulking up their home office. Cohen said travel is only at about 20% of pre-Covid levels, but growth in other expense categories is offsetting some of those declines. He said TripActions' new tools help customers put policies in place for what can and can't be expensed. \"Can you buy lunch? Can you buy office equipment? Can you buy software?\" Cohen said. \"You're doing it with a credit card. The employer wants to have a say in it.\" Cohen said the company, which is based in Silicon Valley, has ambitious plans to build out its global workforce and operations in cities like Amsterdam, Sydney and London. While it's been in hiring mode of late, total headcount sits at 700, well below the 1,100 employees before the crisis. To help some current and ex-employees who may be struggling or who could just use some cash, TripActions is holding a secondary share sale of up to $240 million that will close later this year. Cohen said an IPO is likely a few years out, depending on the vaccine rollout and how quickly business bounces back and becomes more predictable.

Last week, Adventures by Disney announced the launch of cruises to Antarctica and the Galapagos Islands. The first Antarctica tour is scheduled to depart this year, while the cruises to the Galapagos will begin in 2022. The introduction of \"expedition\" cruises marks Disney's third type of cruise service, alongside its Disney Cruise Line vacations and European river cruises.\n\nA family cruise to Antarctica \u2014 for older kids\n\nThe 12-day Antarctica cruise is scheduled to stop at 16 sites in Patagonia, the Drake Passage and the Antarctic Peninsula. The tour begins with two nights in Argentina \u2014 first in Buenos Aires, followed by a flight to the town of Ushuaia, on the southern tip of South America. From there, guests explore Patagonia's Tierra del Fuego National Park by train and Patagonia's waterways via catamaran. Once aboard Le Boreal, a ship operated by French cruise ship company Ponant, cruise passengers will cross the Drake Passage to reach the Antarctica Peninsula. This crossing ranges from smooth to terrifying, depending on the weather.\n\nThe Antarctic Peninsula is the closest part of Antarctica to the southern tip of South America, shown here via two angles.

Adventures by Disney recommends kids be 12 years and older to join and doesn't allow children younger than 10 years old due to \"the duration of the trip, potential for extreme weather or sea conditions and the amount of physical activity involved,\" according to the company's website.\n\nWhat to expect\n\nWeather permitting, travelers will embark on two cruise excursions per day. These range from kayaking and hikes along Antarctica's shoreline to orca spotting and walks to see the continent's penguin colonies. Back on the ship, there are Disney movie nights for the kids and cocktail-making classes for the adults. Naturalists, photographers and other special guests are to give talks and conduct workshops as well.\n\nLe Boreal, a cruise ship from Ponant, has two restaurants, a heated saltwater pool and spa.

The 466-foot ship has 132 staterooms and suites and is able to hold 264 guests and 140 crew members, according to Ponant's website. There is no formal dress code onboard the ship, and the vibe is \"casual.\" The cruise includes water-resistant parkas and rubber boots for passengers.\n\nWhat it costs\n\nPrices for the December Antarctica cruise start around $11,500 for children and $12,800 for adults for a 200-square-foot \"deluxe stateroom\" with a private deck. Prices more than double to stay in the \"owner's suite,\" which is nearly $27,500 per adult. Airfare to and from Buenos Aires is not included in the price. A second cruise, departing on Jan. 30, 2022, is slightly cheaper with rates starting at $11,200.\n\nThe Galapagos Islands\n\nFor Disney fans who prefer warmer weather, Adventures by Disney also announced it will operate five new cruises to the Galapagos Islands starting next year.\n\nDisney's Galapagos Islands expedition tour gives guests the chance to see marine iguanas, sea lions and giant land tortoises.

Greg Baker| AFP | Getty Images\n\nDETROIT \u2014 Ford Motor plans to invest $29 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025, the company announced Thursday when it reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. Wall Street was waiting to see Ford pour more money into the emerging technologies after General Motors announced plans last year to increase spending on all-electric and autonomous vehicles to $27 billion between 2020 and 2025. Ford said its plans include $7 billion in self-driving vehicles and $22 billion in electrified vehicles, up from $11.5 billion through 2022. But not all the announced cash in EVs is new. The company is including previous investments of roughly $7 billion since 2016, bringing Ford's new investment commitment to $10.5 billion through 2025.\n\nFord said a majority of vehicles under the plan will be all-electric, but the company also has hybrid and plug-in hybrid models that continue to have traditional internal combustion engines. \"The transformation of Ford is happening and so is our leadership of the EV revolution and development of autonomous driving,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a release. The company's earnings were mixed. Here's how Ford did compared with what Wall Street expected based on average estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Adjusted EPS : 34 cents versus an expected loss of 7 cents\n\n: 34 cents versus an expected loss of 7 cents Revenue: $33.2 billion versus $33.89 billion expected Shares of Ford jumped by as much as 4% during after-hours trading Thursday before leveling off to about $11.40, up less than 1%.\n\n2021 outlook\n\nFor 2021, CFO John Lawler said the company estimates it will earn between $8 billion and $9 billion in adjusted pretax profits and generate between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. That doesn't factor in a global shortage in semiconductor chips that he said could lower Ford's earnings by $1 billion to $2.5 billion this year. \"The semiconductor situation is changing constantly, so it's premature to try to size what\n\navailability will mean for our full-year performance,\" he said in a press release. \"Right now, estimates from suppliers could suggest losing 10% to 20% of our planned first-quarter production.\"\n\nFord earlier Thursday said it was significantly cutting production at plants next week in Michigan and Missouri that produce its profitable F-150 pickup trucks due to a global semiconductor chip shortage. Automakers and parts suppliers began warning of a semiconductor shortage late last year after demand for vehicles rebounded stronger than expected following a two-month shutdown of production plants due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFourth-quarter earnings", "meta_img": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106274216-1575316780530gettyimages-1137684994.jpeg?v=1612473660"}, "metrics": {"sentiment": {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.9954848289489746}, "keywords": ["Breaking News: Earnings", "Earnings", "Ford Motor Co", "Forward Industries Inc", "Business", "Transportation", "Autos", "Breaking News: Business", "General Motors Co", "Detroit", "business news"], "summary": "Ford said its plans include $ 7 billion in self - driving vehicles and $ 22 billion in electrified vehicles , up from $ 11.5 billion through 2022.
